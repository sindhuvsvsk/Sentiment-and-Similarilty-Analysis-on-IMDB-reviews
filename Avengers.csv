9,"There are some vague references to things that happen and the usual discussion about plot elements available via trailers and pre-release clips, but I have tried to remain as “spoiler-lite” as possible. As always, however, if you’re concerned about maintaining the “virgin” experience, avoid reading this until you have seen the movie.

Avengers: Infinity War knows what it wants to be and goes about pursuing that goal with relentless intensity. An exhausting 150 minutes after opening with a bang, the film concludes with a quieter, solemn moment that illustrates how this movie has done something never previously attempted by a superhero film. No, it’s not a game-changer like Deadpool or Logan. It remains firmly anchored within the “traditional” comic book milieu. But, with an unwavering devotion to spectacle and action, the film throws down a gauntlet where this kind of mass team-up is concerned.
The third Avengers movie is the 19th entry into the ongoing series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and it shows that the long game is approaching its end. Avengers: Infinity War delivers a fan’s wet dream. It’s overstuffed with familiar characters; moves with breakneck speed on a obstacle-filled track that careens between New York, space, Wakanda, and other locales; and ends with a shock to the system. The battles are more visceral and brutal than we’re accustomed to seeing in PG-13 comic book fare. There are moments of pathos and comedy and things happen that I don’t dare mention until the time for spoilers has passed. There’s a sense of incompleteness surrounding the ending that will leave viewers clamoring for the next installment while praying that the filmmakers don’t undo the daring things they accomplished here. 2019’s Avengers movie will go a long way to determining how Infinity War is perceived in retrospect: the first part of a classic cinematic superhero tale or a tease that falls apart when the rest of the story is told.
To summarize the plot would be an exercise in futility. There are too many characters and too much going on. Everyone is embroiled in their own little subplot but the overarching narrative thread is that uber-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) is coming and, unless he is stopped, he will bring with him a universal apocalypse. His goal is to collect the six so-called “Infinity Stones.” Once he gets them, he will have the power of a god and no living entity will be able to thwart him. It’s up to the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and a variety of other non-affiliated MCU heroes to saddle up and engage Thanos and his minions before the Infinity Stones quest is completed. But the Big Bad Guy is as complete and unstoppable a character as we’ve encountered, evolving from the shadowy puppet master lurking in the background to a destroyer of worlds. Infinity War cares enough to give him a legitimate motivation. He’s not a traditional James Bond-flavored villain who’s out for power and dominion. He has a higher calling and it transforms him into a tragic figure of almost Shakespearean proportions. In this summer of Josh Brolin, the actor’s first role may be his most memorable.
The volume of characters guarantees that no one gets much screen time and a few (like Ant-Man and Hawkeye) are absent altogether. If you’re a big Tony Stark fan, know that Robert Downey Jr. clocks in more minutes than most of the actors but that’s still not a lot. Thanos appears more than any of the heroes; in some ways, this is his movie. In order to make things manageable, the characters are broken into groups. Iron Man, Spider-Man (Tom Holland), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) hang out and trade quips. The Guardians – Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Buatista), Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper), Brooding Teen Groot (Terry Notary), and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) – are joined by Thor (Chris Hemsworth) when they find him floating around in space. No-Longer-Captain-America (Chris Evans) returns to the fray, bringing his ex-Avengers compatriots with him. Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) share a few tender moments before eventually winding up in Wakanda with Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) starts out the film with one group (the one he was with at the end of Thor: Ragnarok) before moving on to another then a third.
Much of the screen time is devoted to battles. Infinity War doesn’t waste a lot of time with exposition or character interaction, although there are a few nice moments, mostly early in the film. Banter is generally kept to a minimum, although Spider-Man and Iron Man trade quips even in the heat of battle.  From the first scene to the next-to-last, it’s wham-bam-pow. At times, it’s a little too much; after a while, the sameness of the fighting, even with all the spectacular CGI, borders on monotonous. You can take a bathroom break and not miss anything – they’ll still be slugging it out and blowing things up when you get back. With the stakes so high – 50% of the universe’s population is at risk - it seems odd that it comes down to characters pummeling each other. But there’s nothing truer to the comic book nature of the story than that.
Infinity War delights in throwing surprises at viewers with as much regularity as Iron Man tosses out plasma bolts. The movie is many things but predictability isn’t among its defining characteristics. It goes dark early and often; at times, it almost feels like the MCU has borrowed from the mood of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy (although it avoids the distressingly downbeat tone of Zach Snyder’s DCEU outings). Even the Guardians of the Galaxy aren’t their usual flippant selves – they start out that way but it doesn’t last. The apocalyptic nature of the threat has a way of sobering up even the most sarcastic of superheroes. In my review of this film’s prequel, Captain America: Civil War, I wrote the following: “Consequences, however, are disappointingly limited.” The same can’t be said of Infinity War. This movie is all about consequences – they are numerous and far-ranging.

This movie is a lot of fun, with a dash of substance thrown in for those who care to look (Thanos and his plan are allegorical). It satisfies the deep-rooted escapist desire most movie-goers experience from time-to-time with its spectacular visuals, unflagging pace, and understanding on the part of Joe and Anthony Russo of what MCU fans want from this important piece of the saga. The staunch superhero fan won’t need a morning cup of coffee before seeing Infinity War – the film offers a bigger jolt than caffeine could ever provide. As for those who are fatigued by the genre or were never interested in the first place, there’s nothing in this film that re-invents the comic book movie or morphs it into something else. The mission of Infinity War isn’t to convert the pagans; it’s to satisfy the true believers and, to that end, it succeeds admirably. Twelve months will seem like a long time to wait for the next Avengers movie to see whether the Russo Brothers craft a worthy conclusion to the story begun in Infinity War, but for at least a year we can savor where this story has taken things.",James Berardinelli
7,"It must have taken a superhuman effort to pull together this massive production, the 19th in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which features just about every character from all the movies thus far (except, sadly, San Francisco’s Ant-Man).

Though the result could have been an unwieldy, top-heavy, all-star mess (like 1963’s “It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World”), “Avengers: Infinity War” is a super movie — gigantic, but with an undeniable, powerful, humanity.

The movie’s plot has been teased in Marvel movies for years. Galactic bad guy Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attempting to collect six Infinity Stones; when he does, he can control everything, ending the universe.

It’s an old plot, but it has gravity. Like Killmonger in “Black Panther,” Thanos has his reasons, thinking his actions are for the good of all, even if they come with a vicious price.

As the movie goes on, the weight of Thanos’ task becomes heavier, and Brolin’s canny mo-cap performance makes the character almost touching.
It would be ludicrous to describe the events, except to warn that it’s more or less required to have seen last six movies in the franchise to get what’s going on.

Suffice to say, the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely divides the pack of superheroes into smaller groups, which are more easily managed.

Roll call, in alphabetical order by superhero name, goes like this: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain America (Chris Evans), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie).

The Guardians of the Galaxy are: Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and surly teen Groot (Vin Diesel).

Then: Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and the former “Winter Soldier,” Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).

The list includes others: Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Benicio Del Toro, Gwyneth Paltrow, Peter Dinklage, Winston Duke, Benedict Wong, etc.

At one point, Spider-Man, while trying to help colleagues, gives up and says, “I’m sorry… I can’t remember all your names.”

Humor — carried over from funnier entries like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Thor: Ragnarok” — is welcome, and nicely interspersed with more dramatic moments.
Meanwhile, brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo (of the Captain America movies “The Winter Soldier” and “Civil War”) keep up a snappy, coherent pace.

In the past, the Russos have been camera-shakers, and they still occasionally tend toward the too-quick cut, but they have improved. “Avengers: Infinity War” is their smoothest, best looking movie yet.

What’s different here is that there are consequences. Losses mean something, and it’s disquieting.

These characters have been onscreen for 10 years, since 2008’s “Iron Man,” and even longer on the comic page. Why do we care about them so much?

The answer could be twofold. Superheroes appeal to geeky, awkward kids because of the promise that underneath a misfit exterior lies a special power, if only others could see it.

In today’s troubled world, they also appeal to adults because they use powers to help others. It’s comforting to think that any of us would do the same, if we could.

While not perfect, superheroes are our best possible selves, freed and visualized.",JEFFREY M. ANDERSON
7,"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, “Avengers: Infinity War” makes very little sense, apart from the near convergence of its title and its running time. Early on, someone menacingly (and presciently) says, “You may think this is suffering. No: It’s salvation.” That’s a bit overstated either way. It’s puzzlement and irritation and also, yes, delight. But of course this film, the 19th installment in a series, was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation. In that respect it shouldn’t really be thought of as a movie at all, at least in the ways people with jobs like mine are accustomed to using the word. Which poses a few difficulties, for me and also, I would argue, for you.

Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, scrappy fraternal climbers up the 21st-century Hollywood ladder, “Infinity War” is a chunk of matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a vast entity that long ago expanded beyond the usual boundaries of sequelization and brand extension. This synergistic expression of the corporate interests of Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company — which now include 19 feature films and much else besides — has come to be less a creative or commercial undertaking than an immutable fact of life, like sex or the weather or capitalism itself.
That makes the franchise hard to criticize. You can’t really be for or against Marvel (in spite of the conspiracy theories of some DC fans), and you can’t quite opt out of it either. They don’t call it a universe for nothing: Where else are we going to go? So we make our zigzagging ways, picking out our favorite planets and solar systems, accepting a baseline of tedious, standardized dead space that makes the brighter constellations seem disproportionately fresh and surprising. “Guardians of the Galaxy” was so funny and weird. Not like a superhero movie at all. Same with “Thor: Ragnarok.” Captain America is such a complicated guy. “Black Panther” gave audiences so much to root for and talk about.
Those interesting, unusual specimens — what we used to think of, in simpler times, as “good movies” — aren’t exactly accidents. They are carefully planned exceptions that uphold a rule (meaning a regime as well as a norm) of passive acceptance disguised as enthusiasm. This universe is engineered for variety and inclusiveness, within certain strict parameters. Above all, the Disney-Marvel combination is a giant machine that manufactures maximum consent. The cosmos is theirs. The rest of us just live in it.

I’m not complaining, but rather pointing out how pointless, how silly it sounds when anyone bothers to venture a complaint. Who wants to be a hater? Still, it’s worth noting that the ascendance of Marvel (and of other, not quite as universal entities like it) has narrowed the parameters of criticism. I’m supposed to tell you, in this review, how much fun you’ll have at “Infinity War.” (Yes, you will have some. Will you have enough? Almost.) But I’ve probably already gone too far in trying to think about what it means. The Marvel movies and others of their kind often produce an illusion of profundity, a slick, murky overlay of allegorical suggestiveness. This provides grist for the kind of think pieces that spar with one another — “Infinity War” is liberal; no, it’s conservative; but don’t you see that it’s a protest against Trump; actually, it’s an attack on the tyranny of political correctness — until they catalyze the inevitable anti-intellectual backlash. It’s just a movie! Don’t spoil the fun!

And of course it is with respect to “spoilers” that the policing of discourse is most ruthlessly and effectively practiced. Reviewers who attend advance screenings take a vow of silence about plot details that will be widely known within a week and all but forgotten a week after that. Government secrets are guarded with less care, and requests from public officials to go off the record are addressed with more skepticism. But if I mention which superhero dies, or which one has an unexpected relationship with someone else — well, I wouldn’t dream of it. Not because I’m afraid of Disney executives. It’s the wrath of their obedient, weaponized minions I fear. In other words: you.

This is not a healthy situation. The reasonable concern that major plot elements not be divulged has spawned a phobic, hypersensitive taboo against public discussion of anything that happens onscreen. If, for example, I were to share that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) mistakes Rocket (Bradley Cooper), who is a raccoon, for a rabbit — whoops, you already hit “send,” didn’t you? The joke is repeated a half-dozen times, so it kind of ruins itself. And until the end, the whole thing is weirdly free of any but the most superficial, mechanical surprises.
The action is especially tedious and predictable. I mean both the scenes of fighting and flying and the overall rhythm of the first two hours or so. People talk for a while, sprinkling jokes and morsels of personality into the heavy dough of exposition. Then they fight in the usual way, by throwing giant objects (and one another) and shooting waves of color from their hands. The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination.
There is so much to explain, but basically a large purple fellow named Thanos (Josh Brolin) wants, on vague Malthusian principles, to wipe out half the life in the universe. As you try to keep track of all the good guys massed against him, you may decide he has a point. But he’s not a bad villain. I mean, he’s very bad, but his malevolence is laced with melancholy, and there is a ghastly grandeur to his ambition.

To fulfill his evil plans, Thanos needs to collect six “infinity stones,” which in spite of their awesome power look a lot like what you would find in the craft kit you have been meaning to regift since your kid’s seventh birthday. Also, come on: Another quest for magic gewgaws? This one lumbers from Vormir to Knowhere to Titan, with terrestrial stops in New York, Scotland and Wakanda. Along the way, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) stage a Sherlock Holmes meta-duel and compare goatees. The hunky-Chris showdown — Hemsworth vs. Pratt (Peter Quill) vs. Evans (Captain America) — ends in a three-way tie. Zoe Saldana is heartbreaking as Gamora. If you end up wanting more Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) or War Machine (Don Cheadle), or whoever your favorite happens to be — well, that’s kind of the idea, isn’t it?

But where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act, including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond, as it were) brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. “Infinity War” is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world. But those emotions can also be folded back into the movies themselves. This universe is coming to an end. And then where will we be?", A.O. Scott
8,"If a movie can be defined by the strength of its villain, Avengers Infinity War is a giant. Towering over the spectacle is Josh Brolin's evil despot Thanos, whose striking capture motion performance and physicality comes close to stealing the film. He's a gigantic, power hungry warlord with a chin sculpted like overlong piano keys. He reveals an unexpectedly soulful side, too.

The film is an extravagant mash-up - a dense tapestry into whose digital fabric our Marvel superhero favourites are woven. It's a frenzy of fun and action and directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo have directed this operatic aria with energy and humour.

Ten years in the making, the film is a celebration of 10 years of Marvel's Cinematic Universe and 18 films; beginning with Ironman (2008) and ending with Black Panther (2018). At the worldwide box office, it represents a collective total of $13 billion dollars.

The plot involves Thanos' mission to collect the six Infinity Stones (different coloured baubles representing the elements of Mind, Soul, Power, Space, Reality and Time) so he can erase half the universe.

The integration of superheroes including Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, Tom Holland's Spider-Man, Chris Evans' Captain America is no mean feat. There's humour as Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner struggles to morph into his green counterpart The Hulk. Add Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther in Wakanda and Zoe Saldana's glamorous Gomora plus her android half-sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), whose link to Thanos is key to the plot. I like the way the filmmakers play with proportion and perspective: Peter Dinklage's Eitri fills the screen.

My favourites moments involve Rocket ('the rabbit'; Bradley Cooper) and Groot ('I am Groot'; Vin Diesel) from The Guardians. They are adorable and offer priceless moments. As we watch our favourite superheroes do their bit in the conflict that follows, it is hard at times to know who is fighting whom. But it doesn't seem to matter as we emotionally leapfrog from one reality to the next. Action with a Capital A.

Frenetic signposts lead us to the climactic sequences. There are surprises and shocks and there will be many different reactions to the film's ending. Let me simply say this: there is more to come.

7,"Ten years and 18 Marvel movies; 19 now, with the arrival of Avengers: Infinity War. This must surely be the most remarkable movie series in history, at least since the time when film was the TV of its day and moviegoers got endless installments of Sherlock Holmes fighting Nazis and Charlie Chan solving mysteries. Except the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been one big interconnected story: sprawling, yet also economical, with the chapters and multimovie threads standing pretty much on their own while also sending tendrils out to take root in others. And how they finally come together here… *whew.* It’s almost too much to take in, yet somehow not enough at the same time. I’m not ready to see this story end.
Infinity War is to the decade of MCU storytelling what huge-ass battle finales are to the modern comic-book movie. A single movie may end with 20, 30, or 40 minutes of random mass urban carnage caused by CGI heroes and villains punching one another. Ten years of story gets ya two and a half hours of smash-crash-bash ranging across multiple locales on Earth and multiple planets out in the wider galaxy. Now, Infinity War does not fall prey to the problems that have made some of those big battles tiresome, such as forcing the plot to come to a standstill: the series of interrelated and escalating fights is the plot, anyway. And more importantly, complex and compelling characters don’t take a back seat to the action. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, returning from two of the three Captain America movies, treat the many fight sequences with clarity and originality. We never feel like we’ve seen these huge-ass final battles before. But this may still feel like a slog to anyone who is tired of how this has come to dominate the subgenre, because there’s not much else going on here.

Then, too, there’s an almost a grueling number of characters to keep track of; sometimes it takes forever for the movie to get back to a thread you were particularly intrigued by; other times you’ve completely forgotten someone else was left hanging (sometimes literally) until the movie jumps back to him (or, very more rarely, her). It’s not everyone we’ve ever met in the MCU — there are some notable absences — but it might as well be. Still, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who’ve written or contributed to the scripts for a bunch of MCU flicks, manage to advance the tales of a few of the most beloved of them, mostly Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr: The Judge, Chef), Thor (Chris Hemsworth: 12 Strong, Ghostbusters), and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans: Snowpiercer, What’s Your Number?). Gamora (Zoe Saldana: I Kill Giants, Live by Night) gets a meaty chunk of story, too, though it might feel that way only because she has not been a character explored in much depth before, so there’s lots to learn about her. And also because it is through her and her connection to the villain, Thanos (CGI’d Josh Brolin: Only the Brave, Hail, Caesar!), that we begin to understand how enormous a task the Avengers and friends are facing this time out.
“It’s not overselling it to say that the fate of the universe is at stake,” Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch: Zoolander 2, Black Mass). It seems than Thanos, your basic run-of-the-mill alien madman, is trying to collect the six Infinity Stones, “elemental crystals” leftover from the birth of the universe, which, when gathered together, will allow him to perform evil on a scale previously unknown in the cosmos. Worse, he thinks the evil he wants to do is a mercy. He must be stopped, natch.

Many exciting interstellar venues and planets are visited in this movie; my favorite might be the badass dying-star-powered forge that Thor drops in on in the hopes of getting a replacement for his lost hammer, Mjolnir. But two of these Infinity Stones are on Earth, so our poor planet is a draw for bad guys once again. Apparently these Infinity Stones have been lying around in plain sight! One was in the Tesseract, which has been all over the MCU, including lately in the possession of Loki (Tom Hiddleston: Early Man, Kong: Skull Island); one is in the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany: Journey’s End, Legend), helping to power the android AI’s personality; another is in Strange’s keeping, and fuels his magic. Did we know that these objects were even more than what they appeared to be? I can’t remember. Infinity War has given me a little satisfied tickle of “aha! that’s how it all fits together!” but that might be just because, while I’ve seen all these movies, some more than once, I haven’t studied them.
That might be the sweet spot from which Infinity War is best appreciated, the one between being a complete Marvel neophyte and being too overindulging a fan of these movies, too steeped in the minutiae of their lore, and in that of the comics behind them. I cannot imagine how anyone who hasn’t seen most of the 18 previous movies will find any kind of foothold here from which to appreciate anything that’s happening or any of the people it’s happening to. Never mind missing some of the fun nuances that comes with realizing that, holy crap, so many of the characters here are suffering from major daddy issues — Stark, Thor, Gamora, Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt: Passengers, The Magnificent Seven) — while Thanos is serving as a sort of ultimate stern father to a cosmos that, he believes, has been very naughty and thoughtless, like a child. But without all the backstory of mostly traumatizing experiences almost everyone here has been through, the humor that wends through the movie might come across as unseemly, what with the fate of the universe at stake and everything, rather than a bitter coping mechanism for all these damaged heroes. On the other, I’m sure I can’t even imagine all the inconsistencies and incongruities that have popped up across all of these movies, and I’m glad my head was not full of them as I sat with Infinity War. It’s more than enough for me to have noted that Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland: Pilgrimage, The Lost City of Z) appears to have jumped back in time from the events of his standalone movie, which seems to have been set a good few years after the events here.

From my middle ground — not too geeky, not too mundane — the superhero orgy of Infinity War was a whole lotta just right. And I include in that how it exhausted me, and ultimately how it stunned me. The MCU has been no stranger to darkness, but the darkness here has a depth and a horror that rattled me like the MCU never has before. Yes, there’s another (last?) Avengers movie coming next year, but there’s a finality to this one that, I suspect, will be difficult to dispel.",MaryAnn Johanson
9,"I try to write things that are spoiler free (for the most part). Here it’s kind of hard to talk about anything without spoiling at least something being that it’s the culmination of 20 or more movies so spoilers follow (probably).

This movie delivers. I’ll get that out of the way as many people weren’t sure during the lead up to this film. But this movie hits hard in every way it can. It gives Thanos enough screen time and backstory to make up for him getting almost none before this movie. It gave all the heroes throughout the movie their own story and screen time as well, though a few were settled into the background, such as Black Widow or Warmachine, but they still get plenty of action scenes so it’s cool. I guess I’m a little disappointed they didn’t further explore Black Widows and the Hulk’s romance but I’m a bit of a shipper when it comes to those two…

I have to admit that I’m very impressed. It’s tough to make a movie like this, I mean, any of the Avengers movies is everything that’s come before all mixed together no matter what’s going on in each individual’s storyline. And IT STILL HAS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE! If it isn’t it could kill the whole MCU! I don’t think anything like this has come before where so many different movies crossover so epically every once in a while. I guess DC keeps trying to do things like this but never quite finding the right tone or audience with their movies.
I think I’ll talk a bit about DC vs Marvel for a second. Truthfully, if anyone remembers, before Iron Man came out, DC was the place to be when it came to each universes’ movies. The original Superman and Batman movies are still classics and great adaptations of their comic book counterparts. Christopher Nolan’s the Dark Knight Trilogy was amazing too when that came out. Before Spiderman and X-Men, there wasn’t ever a good Marvel movie and most of them were direct-to-video if anyone even remembers those terrible movies. Oh, wait, except Blade. I always forget about Blade. Man that movie is awesome!… Anyway, Spiderman and X-men were okay, but at the time I think everyone could agree that Batman was better, and no one really took them seriously anyway. That is, until Iron Man came out and Disney showed everyone that they still knew how to make fun movies, and also proved that superhero movies could be more than just two hours of action tropes. It also made a kagillion dollars and then when Avengers came out it was the highest grossing movie ever. So that’s when DC stopped caring about content so much and tried really hard to make their own franchise IN THE LINE OF MARVEL! But the reason it doesn’t work so much is because it’s trying too hard to do what works for them in the comics, being darker and pushing the envelope, but they also are COPYING MARVEL! It’s obvious when they do it and their movies suffer for it. They need to just do their own thing and stop chasing Marvel’s coattails. They struggle to find an audience because they keep rejecting their true fans for bigger game.",Nathaniel R. Mitchell
9,"Thanos (Josh Brolin) has arrived…and he wants the remaining Infinity Gems.  With Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Vision (Paul Bettany) housing stones on Earth, Thanos has sent emissaries to the planet to claim the stones while Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds the stone housed in the Tesseract could bring death to himself, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and the Asgardians.  The Guardians of the Galaxy could hold the key to another stone as the time ticks down to save the universe.  Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) finds himself and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) headed to space in a desperate rescue attempt and a last ditch effort to stop Thanos.  As alien forces amass with Earth in their sights, Wakanda and the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) could be Earth’s best change to save the universe…but Thanos is strong and his power is unparalleled.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Avengers:  Infinity War is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and concludes their “Phase Three” films which began with Captain America:  Civil War (2016).  The movie adapts portions of 1991’s The Infinity Gauntlet and 2013’s Infinity.  The movie follows Black Panther (2018) and was released to massive box office returns and positive reviews.  The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Special Effects
Of the MCU, the Avengers films aren’t very high on my list.  The first film was bloated and dull and the second film just wasn’t very good in general.  As a lifelong comic book reader (30+ years), the comic book boom is something I dreamed of as a kid.  In that sense, Avengers:  Infinity War didn’t fail me.  As a safety measure, a ******spoiler alert****** is in effect for the rest of the review.

The movie above all things is a spectacle.  Visually, it is pretty compelling and really nails down the look of a comic book.  This wasn’t the most difficult thing in reality, they have had eighteen movies to warm up to it and not all hit the mark…but Infinity War does.  It is big, brash, and visual.  The characters really work well together and moments like the throwdown with Thanos on Titan with Mantis, Star-Lord, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Drax, and Doctor Strange present visual high points.  Likewise the battle in Wakanda blended space adventures with something like Braveheart in a way that works…I was really over the over-the-top Avengers music soaring in every time that some character showed up though.
The cast also has fallen into the roles.  There are surprisingly few character Easter eggs in a movie that I thought would try to introduce more and more characters (Ross Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving as a fun Red Skull cameo).  With such a big cast, the movie does a strong job balancing it (for the most part).  There is a lot less time for jokes and one lines from characters who can’t deliver one liners (which is a good thing to me), and I wasn’t sure how all the sarcastic characters like Doctor Strange, Iron Man, and Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord would play together, but they are actually a team…and the meeting of egos works.  The surprising and strongest performances come from Josh Brolin as Thanos himself (though he was originally mocked in early trailers) and his play off of his adopted daughter Gamora played by Zoe Saldana in some of the movie’s only slow moments.
What will work for some and not work for others is that it is a comic book movie at its core.  The action jumps all over the place in a fashion like the Lord of the Rings films and it is a lot of fighting.  It isn’t necessarily a cohesive story as a standalone, and if you haven’t seen a majority of the films, it might make little sense.  This all culminates in an ending that is more set-up for future movies (and could ruin some of the franchises that others like depending what is done in the follow-up Phase 4 movies).  If you loved the Black Panther, you might be a bit disappointed in Avengers:  Infinity War since it takes so long for the characters to show up and Wakanda doesn’t stand much of a chance against Thanos’ forces.  Characters like Hawkeye and Ant-Man were oddly absent (and written off weakly) while the Asgardians were unceremoniously slaughtered off camera after the fun Thor:  Ragnarok…running the risk of being an Alien3 situation (but not quite that bad).  It is this weird balance in the storytelling that could be off-putting to some.

Avenger:  Infinity War is a lot of things.  If nothing else it is a spectacle and amazing as a long time comic book reader.  I know how the story pans out (in comics) and I am already imagining how the MCU will write its way out of the problems of the actors’ contracts running up for the Avengers sequel (scheduled for 2019)…reality can literally be warped so I guess I shouldn’t worry about sequels to the films I like.  Avengers:  Infinity War is followed by Ant-Man and the Wasp in 2018 as well.

7,"Listing the cast members may take longer than writing the review for Avengers: Infinity War, but even with all of these characters to remember, the movie does a splendid job of keeping the plotlines and the characters straight.    There are even helpful titles to tell us where various characters are.   The Lord of the Rings series could have used this and cut down on the confusion.

But, Avengers: Infinity War isn't simply a triumph of keeping things organized, but it also gives us a villain with depth and dimensions.  This adds an extra level of intrigue to his scenes.   Thanos (Brolin) is indeed a very powerful villain, but he also feels love, regret, respect, and sympathy.   Not that these distract him from his goal of wiping out half of the population in the universe, but he even does that more of out of necessity and practicality in his eyes than sheer evil intentions.    We pretty much know what to expect from the Avengers themselves, but there are a few surprises with them also.

The Avengers and The Guardians of the Galaxy are trying to stop Thanos from possessing six infinity stones which would help him reach his goal.    He believes wiping out half of the universe will allow for more evenly distributed wealth and resources.     Ebenezer Scrooge wanted to see the surplus population decreased.    Thanos would tell Scrooge to hold his beer while he took it a step further.   I wouldn't dream of revealing what happens, but this entry in the Marvel Universe deserves credit for allowing its story to go to the dark place it needs to go.

Of course, there is CGI galore and action bulging from all parts of the screen, but Avengers: Infinity War still finds space to tell a story and present us with the most complex villain of the series so far.   Thanos looks like a purple hulk with strength to spare, but his conflicted feelings towards characters like Gamora (Saldana) and Nebula (Gillan) allow his scenes to resonate with us more than just a giant baddie who will inevitably get his ass whipped.    Or will he?   This is the first Avengers film in which the outcome is not etched in stone and its people are allowed to grow at least a little. ",Doug Fisher
9,"For their 19th film, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is looking to shake things up in a significant way. Marvel Studios has adhered to formula before, building a brand name with superhero feats of strength and crisis-solving, spinning an intricate web of characters and motivations. With “Avengers: Infinity War,” the company is looking to add a more pronounced element of surprise, uniting all the big names and fringe players for battle against a powerful foe, and one who’s capable of wiping out the universe with the snap of his fingers. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo try to make the specialty of the community effort unique, generating a sprawling epic that crosses galaxies and takes lives, ordering up towering action sequences and primal emotions, delivering the most psychologically complex MCU event yet. “Infinity War” isn’t concerned with endings, but as set-ups go, it’s a humdinger, going apocalyptic while still retaining familiar beats of humor, heart, and body-smashing confrontations.
The Avengers have disbanded, experiencing separate and joint adventures around the world and beyond. However, new focus on saving the galaxy is critical to the defeat of Thanos (Josh Brolin), a God-like ruler who’s close to acquiring the Infinity Stones, affixing them to his gauntlet of power. If he collects all six stones, his mission to balance the universe, killing countless in the process, will be achieved. Setting out to stop this seemingly unstoppable evil are Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who find themselves visiting Thanos’s home world; Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Groot (Vin Diesel), who are thrust into the fight when they pick up Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in space; Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson), who are trying to remain out of sight in Scotland; and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who’s witnessed Thanos’s strength, teaming with Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) to stand against this unusually contemplative threat.

While it’s not a revolutionary superhero movie, “Infinity War” pays careful attention to Thanos and his mission to acquire the infinity stones. He’s a hulking purple creature with a plan to kill a significant amount of people around the universe, but there’s a method to his madness, with the screenplay identifying his concerns about the balance of life, with overpopulation a primary concern, willing to thin herds everywhere to restore a little sanity and protect natural resources. The idea here is that Thanos doesn’t believe he’s in the murder business, instead acting nobly to salvage what’s left of the living world, using the immense power of the Stones to carry out his culling, with a specific connection made between the villain and Gamora, his adopted daughter who hates him most of all. Brolin’s sensational here, keeping Thanos a measured creature with deep-seated concerns about his endgame, genuinely confused as to why there are those out there trying to stop him. Such psychological weight doesn’t prevent Thanos from becoming an intimidating heavy, but a good chunk of the 149 minute run time is set aside for the titan as he struggles with concepts of sacrifice and power, all the while swatting down challenges to his throne from the superheroes, with help provided by four determined henchmen who make their own messes with enormous spaceships and weapons.
Thanos is the big draw of “Infinity War,” but the essentials of the MCU are represented, once again building on what’s come before. The warriors were scattered after the events of “Captain America: Civil War,” but the new film rounds up the old crew, with the writing juggling a handful of side missions that permit the Russos time to play with established personalities and develop new wrinkles in the unfolding story. Perhaps most inspired is the union of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, with Star-Lord immediately threatened by the new arrival, who eventually teams up with the “rabbit” (Rocket) and the “tree” (Groot, who’s now a videogame-loving teenager) to forge a new weapon for himself, helping to channel his supercharged powers developed in “Thor: Ragnarok.” Banter is strong here, adding some needed humor to the solemn journey, with Bautista once again stealing scenes as the lovably blunt Drax, while Hemsworth clearly relishes the change in scene partners. It’s Gamora who’s gifted the largest arc of the heroes, struggling with her position as Thanos’s adopted daughter, witnessing his deadly march across the cosmos while in possession of key information that could alter his Infinity Stone scavenger hunt.

Already in charge of two “Captain America” sequels, the Russos know how to play in the blockbuster sandbox, choreographing a series of matches between the Avengers and Thanos and his goons, keeping up visceral highlights by focusing on superpowers and flying bodies crashing into walls. It’s a violent feature, but the scale of the chaos is impressive, with the helmers laboring to make “Infinity War” live up to its position as a culmination of the entire MCU, staging major chases, clashes between raging armies, and feisty personality conflicts to butter up the event. There’s plenty of exposition as well, perhaps too much, with wind-down periods scattered around the picture, allowing the production to catch its breath and build to the next explosion of fury, or perhaps a showcase for new outfits, with Iron Man and Spider-Man utilizing the power of shiny nanobot technology to keep them safe from harm.
“Infinity War” travels from location to location, ending up in a few familiar places (including a return to Wakanda mere months after the release of “Black Panther”), and it juggles a large ensemble of characters with startling success, using themes of love and sacrifice to bind the group closer together, giving the comic book soap opera some consequence, especially between the secret lovers in the group. “Infinity War” does conclude with a cliffhanger (the follow-up is due next summer), ending the picture on a slightly underwhelming note, but the Russos and the MCU are creating something expansive and surprising here that genuinely thrills and chills for what’s actually the first half of battle royal I’m positive most fans won’t ever want to see the end of.

7,"Even with a very large cast of characters, this superhero action movie is plenty of fun...

Avengers: Infinity War is the third Avengers movie, where superheroes and villains from various films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe form an ensemble cast to present an epic battle between good and evil. What makes this one noteworthy is that there are so many characters in this one, certainly more than the first two Avengers movies. I mean, just look at the poster for this movie. If Marvel Studios keeps this up, the poster for a future Avengers movie might use up every square inch to show the faces of every character, not to mention the names of each major cast member. So naturally, you might wonder how you could possibly enjoy a movie like this one because of the huge cast. That is why I am presenting this review of Avengers: Infinity War in a format that departs from the usual: as a list of potentially frequently asked questions about this movie and how I would answer each one.

QUESTION: Is it difficult to keep track of each character in Avengers: Infinity War?

 


ANSWER: Thankfully, no. This is not a movie where each character has one distinct plotline so that there are more than 10 to follow. (Then again, can any average person follow more than 10 simultaneous plotlines?) This is a movie where various superheroes come together and end up working in different teams. This makes things much easier. Now you have one plot thread per group of characters instead of one plot thread per character. For example, one group includes Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man, while Thor, Rocket, and Groot form another, and Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax split off in different directions. Sometimes a group loses one member and gains another. The point is that you should be able to keep track of the character groups and their plot threads.

This leads me to the following observation. Even though multiple Marvel heroes appear here, a considerable amount of screen time is dedicated to the Guardians of the Galaxy. That's because the villain in this movie is Thanos, and I am even going as far as to say that you might want to watch this movie partly for the continuation of the Guardians of the Galaxy saga. Of course, if Marvel does make a third Guardians movie, I'm willing to bet that you can watch that one without knowing the events of Avengers: Infinity War. I say all of this just so you have an idea of how much representation certain characters get. But don't worry. The other characters have plenty of screen time, too.

QUESTION: Do you need to see any previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movie before this one?

 


ANSWER: Not really. It is true that Marvel fans who have seen every single Marvel Cinematic Universe movie once (or multiple times if they are die-hard fans) will appreciate seeing connections between those movies and Avengers: Infinity War. But seeing those other movies only serves to enhance enjoyment of this one. It's not a requirement to enjoy this movie or to understand certain plot elements within.

Put it this way. Whenever you see something on screen that no doubt has a backstory in another Marvel movie, all you need to do is focus on what happens going forward. You will find that no backstory is needed for any of the characters. Yes, even if you have never seen any Marvel movie prior to this one, you can still enjoy Avengers: Infinity War. Don't feel left out if you lack knowledge of things like why Thor has a missing eye or the circumstances of Steve Rogers not being Captain America anymore. The writers, I'm sure, took you into account.

QUESTION: When you have one massive crossover of characters, does anything clash and feel unnatural as a result?

ANSWER: It's natural to be wary of fictional crossovers because you don't know if the elements of each fictional work will meld well with each other or feel unnatural with each other. With the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however, there is no need to worry about that at all. When you have a single fictional setting for multiple story series, the writers will undoubtedly take everything in that setting into account when developing a story for specific characters. With this kind of fiction, crossovers aren't just easy to do. They're intended and planned well in advance.

One of the cool things about the Avengers movies, not just this one, is how each featured superhero has unique abilities to fight and defend. This allows action scenes to have different kinds of weapons being wielded and different superhuman powers to use. For example, early in Infinity War, you have Iron Man's nanotech metal suit, flight ability, and explosive weaponry used alongside Spider-Man's agility and versatile web-producing ability and Doctor Strange's power of creating portals. Now and then, you can see the superhero powers helping one another out.

Besides the action, there is no crossover clash when it comes to thrills and subtle humor. The individual Marvel movies have those already, so making a combined Marvel movie is a piece of cake.

QUESTION: How complex is the plot of this movie?

ANSWER: It's really not. All it involves is Thanos seeking all six Infinity Stones in order to have the power to control the universe, and the many Marvel heroes we've come to know and love now have to work together and stop Thanos. I'm willing to believe that it's a challenge for the writers to develop a complex intricate plot when there are so many characters to keep track of. Not that it's possible. It can be done, but extra work is required because you need to connect many characters to the story.

QUESTION: So is this movie really just another standard superhero action movie?

 


ANSWER: Yes and no. Much of Avengers: Infinity War is standard superhero fare because of the action and sci-fi/fantasy elements. But one thing prevents it from being 100% run-of-the-mill: the villain. At first, you might think that Thanos is a mad power-hungry brute who just hates everything. But if you wait, you will get to moments where you learn the motive underlying Thanos's desire for the Infinity Stones. That part of the movie is a reminder that the other side of an argument may still have something sensible and rationale, even if you ultimately cannot join the other side. More importantly, it shows that Thanos is perhaps more of a character who has good intentions but also misguided ideas, rather than a ruthless character with no heart.

Then there is the finale. All I am going to suggest is to throw all good-guy-versus-bad-guy conventions out the window. This movie deserves credit for willingness to deliver the unexpected and shake things up.

QUESTION: What would you say is the core appeal of this movie? Is it characters you care about? A story that is well written?

ANSWER: It's really just the fun action and special effects. To a certain degree, it's fun to follow the story and see what happens to each character, because it's not like plot and characters are nonexistent. They just aren't the major elements of Avengers: Infinity War.

QUESTION: Is this the end of the Avengers series?

ANSWER: Definitely not. Another one is coming out a year after this one. That should be a real welcome after you see how Infinity War ends.

QUESTION: Is Avengers: Infinity War worth seeing?

ANSWER: Based on what I've described, yes. The action is simply a lot of fun. The basic level of plot and character development prevents me from giving it my highest rating, but at least it provides a context for the action. As for where on my 1-to-10 scale this movie falls, it had been close a 9 at certain points, but it was, in retrospect, closer to an 8 most of the way, so that's where I put it. I would also like to take a moment to congratulate Marvel Studios for its 10th anniversary of cranking out movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Avengers: Infinity War is certainly a good way to mark that milestone.",Anthony
6,"Now that we have a film with nearly every Marvel character that has appeared in film on the clock, it’s hard to avoid being reminded of some of the earliest films that really got this ball rolling. Unfortunately, looking back at efforts like Iron Man and Captain America: The First Avenger make it difficult to figure out how we got so far off track in point and purpose over the course of a decade. From films that cared about their characters and delivered an actual story to the deepest reaches of Michael Bay-esque destruction porn in what is apparently a series of calculated moves designed to get us here.

Fresh off the adventures of their respective films, a variety of superheroes are alerted, by Bruce Banner, that Thanos is coming to Earth in his quest to collect all the infinity stones. Banner, having been launched across the galaxy into Dr. Strange’s living room, is going to need to get everyone on board with their new focus of attention, which is an endeavor somewhat stymied by the facts that the Avengers have split into factions and sort of tried to off each other, and no one knows the Guardians of the Galaxy yet.
The film smashes all our favorites together in one of the most glorious fan-service vehicles to ever come along and throws in a collection of villains that no one knows, which means you can’t exactly argue that they aren’t supposed to have a certain magical power. It all gels into one of the best roller coasters you’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Unfortunately, roller coasters don’t have stories.

While certain superhero films in the past have given the impression that they were made by people who didn’t exactly get the source material, Avengers: Infinity War goes the further step of apparently being the work of people who actively dislike their audience and certainly don’t think much of their intelligence. From the smallest of nitpicks having to do with the consistency of the film’s world-building to any examination of the plot, nothing about the film makes the slightest bit of sense, and spinning ever deeper into the nonsensical begins to feel like it is a point of pride for the film.
One of the film’s only moments of actual comedy, which involves Peter Dinklage, who can carry anything, is something of a sign marker letting you know just how flagrant the lack of respect for the genre in general has become. In order to get the magical whatsit, that is given no explanation, that can hurt Thanos, by way of… reasons, Thor must subject himself to something that absolutely will kill him. As Dinklage’s character, Eitri, a Dwarf from magical space town where Thor’s hammer was created, tells Thor, “You will die.” Thor ultimately resigns himself to his fate, and indeed, if this can’t kill him, nothing can. With some gnashing of teeth, a spectacularly shiny display of special effects, and a singe to the beard, Thor not only lives, but is hardly the worse for wear. Perhaps more importantly, the whole “quest” turns out to be a red herring. The overall structure and delivery of the scene makes you imagine asking someone who admittedly hates comic books, “What do you think happens in comic books?”
The rest of the film misses no opportunity to dive into the answer to the question, “What do you think of people who read comic books?” Heroes have powers and abilities, or don’t, as fits the needs of a particular fight scene. Villains who were recently battling immensely powerful heroes, and winning, now rather easily fall to heroes who are either not nearly as high on the food chain, or have absolutely no power at all. Force fields that can withstand being smashed into by a spaceship can’t keep out a dog. Not only is that simply the beginning of the film’s blatant thumbing its nose at you, it doesn’t even dive into the more plot-based deliveries that it hopes it has enough shiny bits to keep you from looking at. Thanos has a henchman that is obviously fantastically more powerful than he is himself. Dr. Strange could obviously “win” this entire conflict any time he wanted. We have the power to destroy an infinity stone, despite the fact that even to put that sentence together requires a misunderstanding of most of the terms, but don’t just aim that power at Thanos.
As if it all weren’t bad enough, and you could go on forever, because every second of the film is built around something nonsensical, Thanos, a character who is rather interesting in his original form, has everything about who he is stripped away and replaced with a commercial for eco-consciousness. I’m not opposed to a Marvel film wandering a road toward generally positive ideas about sustainability, and they’ve done it before. You might find it a commendable idea that we put such ideas into a space of cultural conversation, but they seem to only be interested in connecting such ideas with psychopaths. Josh Brolin can thankfully deliver a bit of character that goes above and beyond what he’s actually given to work with, but it still doesn’t offer something to invest in.
Even considering it’s many problems, many of which may well be neither here nor there for a lot of viewers, this is a film that not only doesn’t have a story, but treads into the largely untested realm of having something akin to the opposite of a story. I mentioned that Thor’s quest for his hammer replacement is really a red herring, but this is a film put together with nothing but red herrings. The vast collection of characters here can’t all fit in one room at a time, so they are off chasing their own versions of potential solutions to Thanos himself, and/or the getting of all the infinity stones, but it is all distraction and repeated excuses to have fight scenes and/or watch something explode, implode, or get smashed to bits.
It’s a movie that can be a fun ride, if you don’t mind that it’s laughing at the fact that you showed up, but when a story only has distractions and they are only distracting you so that you don’t realize there’s nothing there to distract you from, then you’re no longer dealing with a story.",Marc Eastman
7,"This is a film a decade in the offing, one that brings together so many story and character strands from so many different and already-interlocking films that it comes pre-soaked in anticipation, both positive and negative.  If you’ve seen the Marvel films up to this point, you know the setup, and now it’s finally time for Thanos to throw down against pretty much all of the Cinematic Universe’s denizens.

Unlike most Marvel films lately, I went to this opening night (that’d be Thursday, mind you), the first showing at my local theatre, which didn’t get the fan event, 7:00pm.  I was accompanied by over seventy others, with plenty more heading to the various later shows.  There was some applause (don’t get me started…), but the cosplay was kept to a surprising minimum, especially given the far-out wardrobe choices during screenings of Star Wars and Age of Ultron (not to mention the flurry of masques involved with the Fifty Shades movies).  I sat there and imbibed the whole thing, never moving from my seat, never making a sound or much movement, all the way through to the end of the credits (soooo many VFX artists…(including the greatly-named Attila Torok)) and the usual stinger.  Fret not, kids, spoilers are not incoming.  In fact, I don’t have much to say in the way of specifics.
Rather, I have decidedly more general thoughts about the film, and they’re all kinda balanced.  The visual effects are pretty damn great, but yet another completely CGI villain, complete with grandiose, megalomaniacal designs, left me yearning for a literally tangible threat for once.  The acting is fairly strong, the usual from these films by this point, and the writing was similarly on-point, making full use of the panoply of snarky characters at the filmmakers’ disposal.  The emotional points of the story, though, don’t ring quite as strongly as intended, as, despite the various individual buildups from other films, the resonances all have nothing much behind them:  We’re shown ostensibly moving or stirring images featuring characters we’ve known and enjoyed for years now, but the actions all feel too sudden, too weighty, too ultimately hollow to have the intended effect.  For once, a film pretty much needed to be long and complex, and this thing felt like it lasted over two-and-a-half hours, but in a good way.  And yet, this is only part of the immense story, remember: we’ve got another portion coming our way in the future.
There were some nitpicky issues I had with the film, like minor changes to the printed story (like, why is the soul gem not the green one here?) and Elizabeth Olsen’s occasionally disappearing “Sokovian” accent (granted, most of her lines were short and terse enough that the accent could have just been imperceptible, despite it still being there), but on the whole I generally enjoyed it.  It’s failings, though palpable, didn’t quite sink the ship for me, and I left mostly satisfied.

But, of course, I’m a negative asshole, so naturally I found something to gripe about.  Even if this thing had been perfect, all the above issues nonexistent, it still wouldn’t land with the populace at large, at least not fully, not as in instant classic or as a perfect film.  The thing is, despite the fact that we’ve known the MCU films have been building to this pretty much all along, providing a neat story vein to run through each individual franchise and allow for some baked-in interconnectivity, this film is kinda unnecessary.
See, there was no real need to mash together all of the Marvel franchises into the mother of all cinematic monkey breads, as we’ve seen them interact with each other before: Iron Man figuring heavily into the rebooted Spider-Man series, the Hulk showing up in Thor: Ragnarok, the Black Widow appearing in both Iron Man’s and Captain America’s series, usw.  Not to mention the existence of the previous two installments of the Avengers series (and Captain America: Civil War, which was basically Avengers 3, let’s be real), y’know?  With all of those interpenetrations, we’ve had plenty of opportunities for universe-wide conflicts and whatnot, why bother with this big, necessarily bloated slugfest?

You might think money would, for once, not be the prime motivator, what with every Marvel movie making some serious bank for its mouse-eared overlords, but, honestly, nope, it’s still all about the money.  Sure, Marvel movies make miniature fortunes, just look at the success Black Panther has experienced.  But you know what would make even more money?  A spectacle of a film that appeals to all of the different Marvel fans at once and has serious repercussions for all of the constituent series, that’s what.  Just like with the Star Wars spinoffs, you’re bound to expect a healthy return, but the main series is where you’re gonna see the real profits shower in.
I couldn’t keep this thought out of my mind.  Maybe it was because all of these snarksters were jawing at each other to distract themselves from the increasing levels of horror and danger around them, maybe it was the nearly overwhelming amounts of special effects work, maybe it was trying to keep the myriad plot threads straight (while also trying to fully remember the narrative beats from the previous films), maybe it was the culminated weight of ten years of cinema bearing down at me from several yards ahead.  In true Tootsie Pop fashion, the world may never know for sure.  The greed, the incalculable greed, the highly successful greed, it attached itself to my brain and refused to let go.  Remember: I enjoyed the film, in spite of its faults.  But I don’t know it I can say that I liked it, necessarily, ’cause it’s hard to shake just how unnecessary and indulgent it is, how it exists mostly to gild the Disney coffers with a thirty-trillionth layer.  And it’s hard to stomach the fact that I can see this and still enjoy the film, still have a good time, still wanna see where things go in the future.

I didn’t expect to think this much after a Marvel movie, but I did expect to be torn by it.  It was inevitable.  Like I said, there’s no way it was gonna be perfect, there’s no way they could have melded the different styles of the MCU franchises together into a cohesive, seamless unit, there was no way to please everyone.  This film, more than any other I can think of, was doomed to be divisive, doomed to foreseen and possibly even planned imperfection.  Much like Thanos, the filmmakers had a goal that stretched into the heavens, touching several worlds, destroying and creating all the while; and, like Thanos, they had motivations that, though understandable, are hard to fully stand by without a healthy dose of pre-game Kool-Aid indulgence.
I highly recommend the film, especially to Marvel fans, with the caveat that the film will simultaneously meet expectations and disappoint: it’s up to the individual viewer as to how the ratio will figure within each mind.

Remember when they thought comics were just childhood larks?  Wrong then, wrong now.  Someone more talented than I will be able to write an essay for a philosophy class or some media outlet with Infinity War as the basis and my thoughts as the intellectual highway, I’m sure of it.  Honestly, don’t worry about the cite, you good.  You good.",Kyle Saubert
8,"There’s an urge to overpraise Avengers: Infinity War solely on scale alone. As you may have deduced, this is a big ‘um: with significant parts for over 20 MCU heroes and a beefy running time that exists mainly just to pack them all in. This is not a movie concerned with nuance or quiet moments, and the very fact that it stays together with such discipline is a testament to the filmmakers’ skills.

And yet it still exists primarily as popcorn: a chance to deliver the length and depth of the Marvel Universe with the same breathtaking excitement that used to accompany event comic book releases like Secret Wars or Infinity Gauntlet (upon which this one is largely based). It succeeds marvelously well at its primary task, and the fact that it simply lacks the time to plunge into anything deeper than pure entertainment shouldn’t be held against it.

Having said that, some of its best moments come in the quiet pauses between the set pieces, when the gaggle of characters get a little room to breathe and interact. The best of it comes from unexpected directions, and features heroes we haven’t previously seen so front-and-center. Chief among them are the Vision (Paul Bettany) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), engaged in a secretive romance after ending up on opposite sides in Civil War and desperately trying to follow their hearts as the universe comes apart without them. Other moments represent further development from series stalwarts, such as Spider-Man (Tom Holland) who still desperately wants to prove to Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) that he’s ready to sit at the grown-ups table, while Stark watches his grim vision from Age of Ultron start to come true and fights with all his might to stop it.
Naturally not everyone gets such attention, and a number of heroes here exist simply to charge at the bad guys. Captain America (Chris Evans), for instance, does little more than rally the gang and kick some alien butt, while Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is occupied largely with Find the Magic Weapon duties in the depths of outer space. Thankfully, Infinity War never feels like it short-shrifts any of them, since most are series stalwarts with multiple earlier movies to work out their personal issues. (Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye and Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man are the only big no-shows, presumably waiting for later in the summer.)

The bulk of the film focuses on action, of course, and in that realm it has a terrific straw to stir the drink. Thanos (Josh Brolin), the mad titan, has hit upon the notion of solving the universe’s problems by murdering half of it, and to do that, he needs the six Infinity Stones to reshape creation to his will. He dispatches him minions to collect some of them while focusing on the trickier ones himself: setting the terms early on and letting the mayhem unfold as a matter of course.

Said mayhem is glorious of course: in a wide variety of places, with an array of different stakes, and a surprisingly diverse mixture of heroes struggling to halt Armageddon in its tracks. As summer entertainment, you couldn’t ask for more, and yet Infinity War never loses its soul beneath the copious visual effects. Credit for that belongs to its surprisingly thoughtful take on Thanos, his motivations, and the past that brought him to this state. Not only does it give various members of the Guardians of the Galaxy the chance to address their grievances against him, but it provides some understandable purpose to the swirling chaos encapsulated in the movie’s running time. 

Infinity War reaps the benefits in terms of sheer storytelling technique: an impressive feat simply because of the discipline and skill required to deliver so much in such a comparatively tight package. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have already proven their bona fides to the Marvel faithful, and while this one can’t quite reach the brilliance of Civil War or Winter Soldier, that isn’t the purpose of the exercise here. This is a tentpole: the culmination of 10 years of movies woven together in one single, impressive moment. It honors that legacy without leaning on it, finding a few genuine surprises along the way (which I have studiously avoided discussing here) and opening the path to the next stage of this incredible cinematic experiment with the same skill and aplomb with which the MCU built its empire.

At the end of the day, the person most responsible for all of that is Marvel’s resident evil genius Kevin Feige, who never stopped being a hard-core comics fan even as his creation grew larger and larger. His greatest trick has simply been to transfer the experience of buying and reading comics to the big screen. We just pay $12 every four months now instead of $2 every month. But the storytelling techniques are the same, complete with massive crossovers, surprise twists and cliffhanger endings. The MCU remains “Marvel,” first and foremost, and as big as this movie can be, you can still readily spot the pulse of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and countless writers and artists who poured their hearts and souls into those funny little magazines. 

Infinity War – and the MCU as a whole – thrives simply because it never lost that DNA. It’s a straightforward feat in many ways, and we’ve grown accustomed to its presence. But it’s no less rare and no less extraordinary for the results. In and of itself, Infinity War is simply a solid event picture, here to start the summer off properly. But it carries the soul of five-plus decades of comic books at its heart, and with the franchise, it represents showing no signs of slowing down, that fact is worth noting. Who knows how much further this journey will go… and what wonders it will show us along the way.",Robert Vaux
8,"What a movie, this is the third installment of Avengers movie if you don’t include the others such as Captain America: The First Avenger. From the start of the Avengers: Infinity War is somewhat sobering and exciting at the same time because you would see Loki being killed by Thanos then it gets exciting when the Hulk came in an attempt to rescue but then Hulk was sent back to the earth because Thanos was almost as powerful as Hulk at that time with only two stones. Thor tried to take the fight himself due to rage of losing his brother Loki but failed as well and fast-forward to the building of Dr. Strange where a few of the Avengers members would meet up. Hulk, Iron Man, Dr. Strange where Bruce aka Hulk was trying to warn them about Thanos as they sent Hulk back to the earth after being taken down by Thanos on Asgard which was destroyed as well.

The excitement kicks back up when I saw the Spider-Man riding the bus, Thanos army arrived on the Earth to go after the stone that Dr. Strange has and Spider-Man’s hairs stood up as things were happening so he asked his friend to distract the students on the bus so that Peter aka Spider-Man could make an exit to see what was happening up there. Stumbled upon these members of Avengers, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, and Hulk trying to fight off the army of Thanos while trying to defend Dr. Strange as he is one of the stone’s carrier. They near failed to defend Dr. Strange from losing the stone, as Thanos army successfully took Dr. Strange up in a spaceship but in doing so the Spider-Man held onto them and the problem was that Spider-Man was not capable to breathe in space or that several feet high in the sky so Iron Man started chasing Spider-Man to try to save Spider-Man from doing the stupid thing knowing that he was not capable to breathe in the space and Iron Man was too slow so he launched one of his rocket with a new Spider-Man’s uniform because Iron Man knew that the rocket would reach the Spider-Man faster than Iron Man himself could so when the rocket reached where the Spider-Man was as he gasped for breath and it exploded with a brand new advanced technology Spider-Man uniform that latched onto Spider-Man himself then now he is able to breathe in space!

Fast-forward several minutes later, after successfully saving Dr. Strange on the spaceship that Thanos army was using but then a problem occurred! They had no choice but to crash on a different planet because the spaceship was so large that Thanos could only drive so it had to take Iron Man and the Spider-Man to steer the spaceship but ended up crashing safely with the help of Dr. Strange defending the integrity of the ship. Then they met up several more superheroes as they were looking for Thanos too and they bumped into each other!

A few minutes later, what a sad moment!

Anyway, back to the subject! Thanos discovered the cloaked Wakanda! They stormed in but only to find themselves stuck at the side of a protective dome and the Vision was there as they were trying to take the stone off Vision as Vision is another stone carrier! And… Sniff Sniff! Somebody get me a kleenex!

A few minutes later, no I will not go any further here because I don’t want to spoil too much and give in to much of the important parts in the Avengers: Infinity War so you will have to watch the movie yourself to find out to see what it is all about! By the way, I know I have left out so many parts, the results, and whatnot because I meant to do as I don’t want to spoil too much! The bottom line is, this movie is great but at the same time, it is sad and it is action-packed! I highly would recommend the movie, Avengers: Infinity War and if you have not watched any of Avengers movies then I would recommend that you start with the first movie so that you can understand a lot of the parts that were going on in Avengers: Infinity War otherwise you may be confused!

Here’s a Marvel Movies In Order List that you can see all of the movies in order with Avengers movies so that you can start watch and get yourself up to Avengers Infinity War or the newest one Avengers: Endgame! This movie and as well other Avengers movies are great but you can see that it was coming to an end especially in the Infinity War. Avengers: Endgame is the last film for Avengers which is unfortunate for Marvel fans including myself. I haven’t watched the Endgame but will be soon and once I do I will definitely review the movie as well!",Joshua Sullivan
9,"Avengers: Infinity War is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and stars Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johannsson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Dave Bautista, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olson, and basically every other Marvel character you can think of. It tells the story of the arrival of Thanos and his quest to collect all six infinity stones which will allow him to destroy half the universe with the snap of his fingers. We have had ten years and 18 films worth of buildup to get here and the time has finally arrived. Could Avengers: Infinity War be worth the wait and be the film we have all waited for? 100% yes. Avengers: Infinity War is a stunning achievement that will leave you satisfied. All the buildup and all the hype have been leading to this and the payoff is beautiful.
Let first start off by saying that this is going to be a difficult film to review for two reasons. For one, there are many things here that could be considered a spoiler. All the heroes and all the moments are difficult to talk about without giving away a major detail. The other reason being that I am still speechless and in awe of what I have just witnessed. If you have invested yourself into this franchise and care about these characters, then you will be emotionally drained by the end of the film. That is something to applaud. Marvel has now put out 19 pictures full of different stories and characters with one through line to keep it all together, Thanos. The fact that the buildup paid off this well is astounding and an achievement that will be rare to come by again.
Now let’s get to the giant purple elephant in the room, Thanos. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is everything you had hoped he would be. He strikes terror into the hearts of the heroes and the audience. My heart was constantly pounding because I was so nervous for these characters that I love. NOBODY is safe when Thanos shows up and you genuinely feel like there is no way to stop him. His lackies called The Black Order look visually impressive but, in the end, are not much more. You quickly realize that Thanos is the only one we should be scared of, and he also looks visually amazing. I know I just wrote a whole paragraph about Thanos, but its because he is one of the greatest villains you will ever see on screen. Avengers: Infinity War is his film and you understand his motivations, even though he will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. Be scared.
Now I want to discuss what we all came to see and that is what its like to see all of our favorite characters come together. Joe and Anthony Russo had the task of trying to balance all of these different franchises and personalities together, and they pulled it off. We have seen The Avengers together, but now mix in the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Spiderman, and Black Panther. What you get is a well-balanced, action-packed, and emotional journey involving all our heroes together. The standouts of the film to me are Thor, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, Vision, Scarlett Witch, Starlord, Dr. Strange, and Gamora. The rest of the heroes are terrific as well, but these guys really stole the show for me. I mean its amazing to see Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Pratt clash. Zoe Saldana however really gives the emotional punch that the film needs. She being the adopted daughter of Thanos, so you can guess she has a big role to play. Now this brings me to the rest of the characters. Every Avenger gets their standout moment, but some feel more powerful than others. With there being so much going on, it is hard to give everyone a great moment, and the Russo’s did it the best it could be done.
One final aspect I want to touch on quickly is the people behind the scenes of Avengers: Infinity War. Alan Silvestri returns to score the film here and you can feel the immediate difference he brings. His theme for The Avengers will become iconic now and his stylings are the best he has ever done. Now I want to address The Russo’s. There guys accomplished what should have been the impossible and made the best Avengers movie to date and one that will be remembered for generations to come. What Joss Wheedon did was great, but Anthony and Joe Russo took it to another level. You can tell that they appreciate and love the comics this film is based on, and their love is poured onto the screen. I am both excited and scared to see what they bring next to Avengers Untitled because I do not know how they are going to top this. That is one of the great things about this is I really have no idea where the story is going to go from here. We are left on a cliffhanger that also feels like an ending and I could not be more curious to find out what is next.
Well at the end of it all, Avengers: Infinity War is the film all comic book fans and film fans alike have been waiting for. What we once thought would never happened finally has and Marvel will forever be applauded in history for what they have done. This is an action-packed, funny, and emotional journey that will leave you both satisfied by the quality yet wanting more. You can’t get enough. Two and a half hours flies by and you will want to buy another ticket immediately. I obviously recommend Avengers: Infinity War and will be happy for all the success this film receives. I’ve never been so happy to be emotionally empty.",KYLE ARANGO
9,"Marvel Studios has accomplished something seemingly impossible. They have created an entire universe full of franchises that ebb and flow with excitement for not only the team-up films, but the solo efforts as well. The idea started ten years ago with Iron Man (2008), a blockbuster that is about as standalone as it gets until its post-credits scene. There, we meet Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury and he tells Tony Stark (who is but a surrogate for the audience) that there is an “Avengers Initiative.” The seed was planted, but it didn’t fully bloom until four years later when Marvel unleashed The Avengers (2012). Not only did that film pay off elements established in the five films that came before it, but it also laid the groundwork for everything that came after. The Avengers raised the profile for every Marvel character and resulted in each of the solo sequels earning more at the box office. Marvel Studios created a cycle (which they call phases) where audiences could follow their favorite characters in their own movies, then introduce new characters, and see them team up in bigger films. They perfected what comic book readers love about comics, and now it seems movie audiences love this type of storytelling too.
More so than say Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) or Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War feels like the true culmination of the eighteen films that came before it. Nearly every protagonist seen in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films makes an appearance in this gargantuan film. In what could have been a daunting task for any director (or in this case, directors), Anthony and Joe Russo once again nail the spirit of an MCU movie while balancing an enormous cast of wide-ranging characters.

Thanos says it best, “Perfectly balanced, as all things should be,” and while he’s talking about the vision he has for the fate of the universe, he could be referring to the approach the Russo Brothers took with this movie. The directing duo, also responsible for Captain America: The Winter Solider (2014) and the aforementioned Captain America: Civil War, balance a universe-sprawling epic plot with plenty of heart, humor, and big budget thrills that is sure to leave any viewer floored. They aren’t afraid to take risks either as Infinity War is truly one of the most shocking MCU films to date and will likely leave more than a few viewers gutted by the time the credits roll.


 This film, more than any other in recent memory, must be experienced more so than read about. A plot summary or synopsis will not do the grand scope the Russo brothers were trying to accomplish justice, but the set-up is simple: Thanos (Josh Brolin) wants to gather all six Infinity Stones (five of which have been seen in other MCU movies such as The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World [2013], Guardians of the Galaxy [2014], Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Doctor Strange [2016]) so he can wipe out half the galaxy with the snap of his fingers. Heroes like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and the various Guardians of the Galaxy don’t like the sound of that, so they try to stop the Mad Titan from gathering all the stones. There’s a lot of characters doing a lot of things, so those who have kept up with the MCU thus far will have a leg up on those who haven’t been doing so. The filmmakers assume you have seen most of the other movies so they spend little to no time defining the characters, which is fine since that’s what the other movies were for. This truly is the ultimate payoff of a decade worth of films and it rewards fans ten-fold. In fact, the bigger the fan you are of the MCU, the more you are going to get out of this movie, which is another way of saying that this might not be a great jumping off point for those who have never seen a MCU movie.

The story is sprawling and epic in every way imaginable, but it’s also remarkable how each character still feels the same from their previous installments. For example, heading into the film I was slightly nervous about how the Guardians of the Galaxy were going to come off since they weren’t being written by James Gunn, who had done the two Guardians films. That worry was unfounded as the Guardians as they were in their own movies, and kind of steal the show. That holds true for the rest of the characters as Marvel has truly mastered how to transition their characters from solo movies to the team-up films almost seamlessly. It’s not only a treat for any fan to watch, but it’s also immensely rewarding. Character arcs from other films pay off in big ways—especially when it comes to Thor. This is impressive when they are essentially introducing the character of Thanos. Yes, we have seen Thanos in other films before this, but this is the first time we get to know the character, and he’s arguably the lead of the film. It goes back to how well-balanced the film is that the Russo brothers can afford every character their own moment to shine while also giving Thanos the proper introduction and arc he deserves. Brolin absolutely kills it as Thanos as he nails the overwhelming power of the character while also playing the character with subtly and nuances that aren’t usually seen in a comic-book villain. He isn’t mustache twirling or overly dramatic, he just believes that this is what needs to be done and he’s the only one who can do it.
Lots of people go to these movies for the big budget spectacle, and the Russo brothers make sure that those people will not be disappointed. The film has numerous action set pieces, all with varying levels of scale, which keep them from all feeling the same. There’s some action moments with two or three characters, and then there’s the epic war-sized action scenes, both of which are handled expertly by the directors. The two showed that they could do more grounded fight scenes in Winter Solider, then proved they could handle group battles in Civil War, and then doubled-down to make Infinity War. The action is clever and fast-paced with characters in groups we have never seen before. Every character has a moment to shine, once again bringing it back to the film’s unbelievable balance. Thanos proves to be a unique challenge for the Avengers and the film features many clever ways as to how they attack the mighty villain. There’s fun to be had, but the film does start to struggle with how and when to show all the action. There’s essentially two climaxes happening at the same time and the film cuts between the two without much reasoning, even at times undermining some key moments. It’s all in service of telling the larger-scale story, but it does show that there is at least some validity in the argument of this film being simply too big.

That is an incredibly minor road bump in what is one truly incredible ride the Russo brothers expertly guide MCU fans on. Avengers: Infinity War could have been a hot mess with too many characters and the weight of 18 previous films crushing the overall enjoyment of one movie, but the outcome is the complete opposite. Avengers: Infinity War is fun and thrillingly zips through its 156-minute running time and features an ending that shows the MCU can still deliver the audience high stakes indeed. The bigger fan of the MCU you are, the more enjoyment you will take from Avengers: Infinity War, but even mild fans will enjoy the sheer scope of the film. It’s a gigantic ride that will leave you breathless and anxious for Avengers 4.",Scott Davis
8,"Ten years, nineteen films and the most audacious experiment in franchise filmmaking ever: the conclusion to Marvel’s grand project has finally arrived. The biggest entry in the studio’s series to date, Avengers: Infinity War is at once exhausting, exhilarating and triumphant.

Thanos is coming. Ever since the Mad Titan (Josh Brolin) was teased at the end of Avengers Assemble, the threat of his arrival has lurked in the shadows of every entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But with the most frequent complaints levelled against the mega series being the lack of long-lasting consequences and underwritten baddies, it wasn’t enough that Thanos merely showed up to the party: he had to play for keeps. And boy, does he, both in terms of Brolin’s operatic performance, his truly cosmic quest, and writing with enough depth to make his genocidal vision almost understandable. X-Men take note – this is how you write the Apocalypse.

Beginning in media res, Thanos has decimated the Asgardian refugees last seen at the end of Thor: Ragnarok and has already acquired the power stone – one of six gems with the power to end the universe – from the planet Xandar. The film’s first act has a lot of narrative ground to cover, but its sheer sense of urgency balances out any expositional overload. Nevertheless, Infinity War asks a lot of its audience and expects as a bare minimum a working knowledge of the series timeline to date. Moreover, that aforementioned urgency means any breathing room for meaningful characterisation is dispensed with, the expectation being that we all know by now the main players.

Infinity War’s unwieldiness does beg the question of whether it works as a film in its own right. It’s an exhausting barrel roll of a narrative, functioning less as a complete story and more as a frenetic series finale, the last act of a lengthy space opera. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo spin a universe-spanning array of plates to include almost every major character in Marvel’s playhouse, each with brief but well-drawn motivations – an impressive feat in itself. The effect can be dizzying, but there’s no denying the consummate skill in cross cutting between three disparate sets of heroes, multiple set pieces in parallel and the star villain in the centre. Indeed, rather than a sequential narrative, Infinity War more resembles an enormous comic splash panel on the screen.

The rousing Avengers theme – the most memorable of Marvel’s otherwise underwhelming scores – is used frequently and with brio by veteran composer Alan Silvestri. Visually, it’s no exaggeration to say this is the studio’s most cinematic film to date. Trent Opaloch’s cinematography balances cosmic scope and spectacle with performance-privileging close-ups, while Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt’s editing miraculously maintains the dramatic impetus crucial to keeping the whole enterprise afloat.

Easily the best of the three Avengers films, Infinity War is not quite up there with the human-centred drama of Black Panther or indeed the Russos’ Captain America entries. And despite the film’s operatic grandeur, it simply can’t hold a candle to the emotional and thematic heft of a Dark Knight or a Logan. Additionally, though there are heavy consequences galore here, one suspects that many of them will be undone in next year’s Avengers follow-up – an unfortunate case of commercial prerogative triumphing over dramatic integrity. Nevertheless, as an unfathomably huge, wildly entertaining blockbuster and the culmination of a grandiose experiment, Avengers: Infinity War is a titanic achievement.",Christopher Machell 
10,"Too often in comic book stories, the villain is motivated by greed or power. They not only are evil, but they know they are evil, and you will submit to them or fork over all your cash, depending on the depth of their megalomania.

The best villains, however, see themselves as the heroes of their own story, and act accordingly. Thus it is with Thanos, in a lifetime achievement role for actor JOSH BROLIN. All Thanos wants to do is eliminate poverty, make sure there are plenty of resources for people to live on, and see the universe at peace. And to do this, the only thing he needs to do is simply cut the existing population in half.

That's a lot of life to have to snuff out. But he can do it, if he acquires all six of the so-called Infinity Stones, gems of amazing power created at the moment of the Big Bang. We've seen these stones in different Marvel Cinematic Universe pictures, although they haven't always been called by those names. Thanos's quest to acquire these stones takes him the length and breadth of the Marvel Universe, and it is a credit to directors Anthony and Joe Russo that at no time in this tour-de-force does the viewer ever get lost.

Everyone who's ever appeared in the MCU is in this film, including some villains you thought you had seen the last of a long time ago. The plot threads of THOR: RAGNAROK, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY V2, BLACK PANTHER, and CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR all come together, making clear how these different movies were all parallel chapters that were inexorably leading up to this point.
For it's length, INFINITY WAR is incredibly fast paced, almost impossibly mixing action, drama, and comedy into a tapestry of pure superhero movie genius. The interactions between characters like Spider-man (TOM HOLLAND), Iron Man (TONY STARK), Doctor Strange (BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH) and Star-Lord (CHRIS PRATT) are fantastic. The reticence of Hulk (MARK RUFFALO) underscores just how deadly a foe Thanos is, and the arrival of Thor on the scene of one of the battles had the audience in our press screening clapping and cheering.

There's so much to talk about with INFINITY WAR -- seemingly infinity, appropriately enough. But the only way to really appreciate the scope, depth, and -- ultimately -- jaw-droppingly tragic film is to experience it for yourself. We look forward to a spirited conversation in the threads below!",RJ Carter
9,"What the...? Like many Marvel fans, I was eager to see last night's long-awaited Avengers Infinity War. I had my concerns – like how do you cram that many superheroes into one story line without it seeming, as one review has it, 'over-stuffed'? Will it make narrative sense? Or will it just come across as beauty pageant for squabbling super-egoes?

The answer, to my relief, was that it worked and, mostly, worked well. OK. The strain showed in one or two places. But on the whole it is a thumbs up for an ensemble movie that many feared even experienced directors Joe and Anthony Russo could not prevent from descending to meaningless jumble. It did not.
OK. There was some trade-off between cast size and plot subtlety. Because there was nothing terribly subtle about the plot of Infinity War. The film opens with a MayDay from an interstellar craft that Marvel fans will quickly realise is the one last seen escaping the fall of Asgard in Thor: Ragnarok.

Cut to onboard, where psychotic murderer/benevolent philanthropist Thanos (Josh Brolin) – it depends on your point of view – has just finished wiping the floor with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Loki, it seems certain, does not survive this encounter. And then we're off, with Thor escaping and Thanos on a galaxy-wide quest to locate the Infinity Stones, which, once assembled in one place on his gauntlet will give him immense unstoppable power.

Any similarity between the plot of this film and a game of Trivial Pursuit begins and ends with the colour of the stones (blue, red, yellow, purple, green, and orange) which almost exactly match the six colours of pie (blue, pink, yellow, purple, green and orange) that you need to collect to win the latter.

The difference? The worst consequence of Trivial Pursuit is that the winner can get a little big-headed and insufferably smug for a while: whereas the aim of Thanos, once he has collected all the pieces of pie – sorry, infinity stones – is that once he has them assembled he will be able to wipe out one half of all life in the universe.

So it is chase and jeopardy. Different sub-sets of the Avengers, including Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Spiderman (Tom Holland), Doc Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and many, many, many more coalesce in locations across the Galaxy, just in time to be beaten to the local infinity stone by Thanos.

There is a great side-arc in which Thor reforges his hammer – a sort of Mjollnir mark two with added rainbow powers. And there is more insight, back story to characters like Gamora. In the end, though, most return to Wakanda, the Kingdom of T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) for a grand finale confrontation with Thanos and his forces. Which is where the surprise and the spoiler and the thing I have promised on no account to tell you about happens.

Along the way there is the usual banter and clashing of egos.. In advance, I had misgivings as to whether the pace and style of, say, early Avengers could be brought matched to more played-for-comedy films like Guardians Of The Galaxy. My fears were misplaced. For there has been a long-term convergence across the massive story arc to which the Infinity War represents culmination.

The ego-clash between Tony Stark and Doc Strange is to be expected and here handled with a masterful combination of serious and wise-cracking, as well as contemporary reference aplenty. In this case to the Ben and Jerry specials named for their respective characters! Ditto the first encounter between Thor and Star Lord in which Quill, feeling his masculinity affronted by the mere presence of the Asgardian, attempts to lower his voice to match Chris Hemsworth's delivery.

There is also loss and much sadness, too. A constant recurring theme is whether one individual should sacrifice him/herself for the sake of the many. It's a dilemma faced in different ways by two very different couples: Quill/Gamora, and Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany).

And in such a battle, it is inevitable that many will fall. Infinity War does not end with Avengers triumphant, save one lone casualty: there are many, and who will be resurrected again through future plot twists, we must wait and see. Infinity War is a clearing of the decks: opportunity for new characters and plots to emerge; opportunity too for some characters to move on.

Any failings? Yes: for despite running to over two and a half hours, there were plot threads and themes not explored as much as I would like. Both Thor and Doc Strange were, I felt, under-played, given that they represented the two most powerful pieces on the battlefield after Thanos. In the case of Thor, it was the plot that kept him away from the action. For Doc Strange, it was script weakness that turned all of his dark arts into hand signalling – and one cryptic prohpecy about how Thanos might be defeated.

I am now looking forward to the director's cut which, I would expect to run to well over four hours!

Also, once seen, it cannot be unseen. An analysis of Star Wars by someone who knows a thing or two about military tactics, highlighted the ridiculousness of modern armies, armed with advanced particle weapons, forming up like some ancient world phalanx...then abandoning their positions to charge across a battlefield and engage with the enemy. Like, no commander in their right mind would do that.

But it makes for good cinema. And so these were the tactics on display in Wakanda once more.

Despite all of that, a brilliant Marvel film.

9,"Marvel and The Russo Brothers had a very daunting task before them. Paying off the culmination of a decade of build-up and backstory, stretching over 18 films, is a challenge unlike any studio or director in Hollywood had ever faced. And to accomplish this feat, they worked with what has to be the largest cast of known stars ever assembled for a movie. The ambition of Marvel and its commitment to the cinematic universe it pioneered is worthy of praise and respect.

If there’s one thing I was looking for in Avengers: Infinity War, it was raised stakes. Much like the comic books these films are based on (in which characters rarely die and cities are destroyed without much afterthought), Marvel films have not fully dealt with loss in a way that seems realistic. Right from the start of Infinity War, though, Marvel makes it very clear that has changed. The potential consequences of a Thanos (Josh Brolin) victory are evident and the film progresses with an emotional weight and sense of urgency that it could not have attained if the studio followed its same old formula. This also creates much more investment in characters and the worlds they inhabit, and thus pays off quite a few very moving scenes in a much bigger way. If you haven’t cried in a Marvel movie before, you’re not alone, but this may be your first. I had genuine chills a few different times. But don’t worry, that trademark Marvel humor and witty one-liners are still there and won’t have you depressed for too long at a time.

Another area that Marvel outdoes previous films in their own franchise is with Thanos himself. Make no mistake, this is his film and his story. He is a fully developed villain with more screen time than any before him, and it helps to create a character with whom the audience can both despise and yet struggle with feelings of empathy for. Brolin’s talent is very obvious in this performance despite the incredible looking CGI that encompasses him. His Thanos is not just some loud, angry, destructive villain. He is intelligent and calculating. He is nuanced. He is cold, yes, but when he gives his reasons for what he wants to do with the Infinity Stones and why, in a very warped way it makes some sense. His presence as the foil to the Avengers and Guardians gives this film something unique and memorable.

With a cast this large it is inevitable that not everyone’s favorite will have the responsibility or amount of action they hope for. The Russo’s do an admirable job of balancing these heroes, however, and somehow left me feeling satisfied. Sure, a little more backstory or deeper character moments for them all would be nice, but it’s also unrealistic to expect in a single film of this length. By managing to give everyone at least one small moment in the sun, the Russo’s succeed where I believe many would have failed. Another result of keeping most character development small is that the film moves fast, pausing a few times for majorly impactful storyline beats, but mostly cutting between different groups of heroes working to accomplish different tasks. By keeping the heroes in smaller groups, we get to feel more focused when we’re with them, and enjoy the new forms of dialogue that emerge between characters who previously had not interacted.

The action in Avengers: Infinity War is, as expected, fantastic. Seeing heroes fight together with new gear and weapons, or teaming up in ways never experienced by movie goers before, was a huge treat. In one major battle that involves a host of heroes and countless alien attackers, the Silvestri score and rising stakes create a feeling similar to that in the Battle of the Pelennor Field from The Return of the King. While Avengers: Infinity War never quite reaches that level of epic, it comes much closer than many (myself included) ever thought possible.
If you’re thinking that this review is a but vague, please know that is by design. Fans have waited 10 years for this and going in with as little information possible is going to result in the best viewing experience. Avengers: Infinity War isn’t entirely unpredictable, but it’s got some surprises too. The historic puzzle that the Russo Brothers have put together is nothing short of amazing and will lend itself to multiple viewings. Perhaps that’s the highest praise possible for a film of this kind, that after it finished I immediately would have sat through those 2.5+ hours again. To sum it all up, Avengers: Infinity War lived up to the hype by being both entertaining and emotional. Well done, Marvel. Well done.",Aaron White
8,"Thanos (James Brolin), the Mad Titan, already in possession of two Infinity Stones, the most powerful substances in the universe, continues his quest to collect the remaining four stones, to complete his Infinity Gauntlet, to go forward with his self-appointed mission to achieve balance in the universe, by indiscriminately annihilating half of all existence. It may take the combined efforts of the entire Marvel Universe to stop his mad campaign.

AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the most ambitious project to come out of Marvel Studios, is the big screen adaptation of the 1992 series created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It involves nearly every character from the last ten years of the Marvel franchises, including the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and other Marvel franchises. Although only six-issues in length, the actual storyline covers over a dozen titles, including Fantastic Four, Moon Knight, Alpha Flight, and other more obscure titles. Despite the scope of the series, the film only focuses on the physical confrontations in the recovery of the stones. This is a darker film, not as morose as the DC films, but it is a depressing tale of loss, and not only of peripheral characters. It does have the trademark Marvel humor, but the one-to-one interactions were more heartfelt.

 


On the positive side, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR features some outstanding visuals, both CG and practical, and their interactions were seamless. The film should walk away with very visual effects award at the Academy Awards.

On the negative side, despite the scope of the original series, the film focused mainly on fist fights and explosions, rather than the expansive space opera of the original story. Gone were Galactus, the Eternals, the Living Tribunal, even Death, who was central to Thanos' ambitions. With all the money spent on the vistas of warfare, carnage, and wardrobe changes (Spidey gets a new suit, Iron Man gets a snazzy nanotechnology suit, Brue Banner hops into the Hulkbuster suit, and even Captain America loses the Red, White, and Blue to basic black), more effort should have been given to showing more off-world scenes. Oh, and the Black Widow is now a blonde.

However, the biggest thumb in the eye, is where the story leaves off. Originally, INFINITY WAR was scheduled to be a two-parter, but for reasons unknown, there was no indication when, or even if, the story will continue.

On my personal rating scale, with ""5"" being drop everything and see the video now; if you're female, bear the producers' children and ""0"" being burn down the theater, murder the staff, and violate their dog, this movie earns a ""4,"" simply because it was not the feel-good movie that is the modus operandi of Marvel films There is a teaser at the very end of the credits, but it tells you nothing.

9,"Infinity War marks the ten year anniversary of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A shared universe that started with 2008’s Iron Man and later that year The Incredible Hulk. This is the 19th movie in this universe and for now this is the moment all the previous movies have been working to. Thanos, who was mentioned by name a couple of times in other movies as well as appearing in a post-credit scene of the Avengers finally takes the center stage.

His plan is rather simple as it can be summed up in two sentences: He is looking for the six Infinity Stones because they give a person the power of a God. He wants to use this power to wipe out half the population in the entire galaxy to restore order. Apparently over-population is not just exclusive to Earth. The only people who can stop him are the characters of all the previous M.C.U. movies. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Panther and Spider-man to name a few.


The previous Avengers movies have proven that ensemble movies can work. The disappointing output by Warner and DC however also proves that in order for ensemble movies to work the characters need to have their own movie first to establish them. Marvel understands this, but Avengers: Infinity War is their most ambitious ensemble movie yet. According to people who have been keeping track there are around 28 heroes in this movie.

With 28 central characters it’s hard to give each character enough screen time and/or development. Luckily all the central characters are already established in the previous 18 movies.  This is however the weakest aspect of Avengers: Infinity War: this is not a standalone movie. If you have never watched an M.C.U. movie, you can’t just walk in and understand who the characters are or what’s even going on. The movie’s target audience are the people who have avidly watched all the previous movies. It’s like those Transformer Combiner toys. If you have all five you can combine them to create another Transformer. It’s the same here: watch the 18 preceding movies and you will fully understand this latest Avengers movie.
If there is a central character in Avengers: Infinity War it’s the villain Thanos. This is his movie and he receives a lot of screen time. It has been said that Marvel has a villain problem. Villains tend to be underwhelming and instantly forgettable. I don’t always think that to be true and this year we already had a great villain in Black Panther’s Kilmonger. Thanos is another great villain, whose arc is almost Shakespearean tragic.

Avengers: Infinity War crams a lot in 156 minutes and at certain moments it can feel overwhelming. The cast has been divided into small groups who each have a different task at a different location. This way there several stories going on at the same time, constantly switching between them until almost all of them come together for the finale. Much of the fun comes from putting characters together who otherwise would never interact together. Tony Stark quibbling with Dr. Strange and Star-Lord on a remote planet for instance.

Another weakness of the M.C.U. is that all movies are just basically set-ups for the next one. Therefor there is little at stake for our heroes. Of course they’re never seriously in jeopardy, but it does come off as a self-parody when even the small parts are coming back from the dead. A long time comic book trope. Agent Coulson was killed of in The Avengers, but resurrected for the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. TV show. Even a main villain like Loki has cheated death now multiple times.

After 10 years and several contracts ending after the next Avengers movie, everything is on the table now. The movie does deliver in this department as it actually kills off several big players in the M.C.U. The question remains whether dead is really dead. This is a brave choice by Marvel, but I’m curious if they will cheat the audience by cooking up some convoluted scheme to undo Thanos’ handiwork. That fact that one of the Infinity Stones is a Time Stone is rather worrisome.

Avengers: Infinity War is a movie that ends on a cliffhanger. It’s also the bleakest Marvel movie to date. This is as close as Marvel has come to the darker tone of the average DC movie. But there is still much to laugh. There are moments of humor even in the fiercest battles. These moments made me slightly chuckle, though they had some audience members in stitches.

Avengers: Infinity War has some flaws, but I found it to be an impressive and overall really enjoyable movie. Despite the dour undertone or maybe even because of it.  This movie finally feels if there are actually things at stake here. There is the constant feeling that certain characters can meet their demise at any minute. Especially human characters like Iron Man and Captain America. How much will a simple suit do against a God?

Avengers: Infinity War isn’t a perfect movie, but it’s a perfect Marvel movie. This is what they have been building up to these last 10 years. It does feel like we’re reaching the end of something. This movie does not work as a standalone movie, but as the penultimate chapter to an incredibly large franchise it’s an amazing cinematic experience. This movie left me wanting more as soon as the end credits started rolling. It is going to be a long wait.",Mikey
6,"So this review is going to be shorter than my normal reviews for major releases because it is really difficult to explain my problems with this movie without going into spoilers so expect a spoiler discussion later. 10 years and 18 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has led to this moment. Avengers: Infinity War begins shortly after the events of Thor: Ragnarok as the Mad Titan Thanos has attacked with the goal of obtaining all six infinity stones. Once obtained, Thanos will be able to fulfill his dream and wipe out half the population of the universe with a snap of his fingers.

A few notes about this movie. Thanos is EASILY the best villain in MCU history. The film is at it’s best every time he is on-screen. He’s menacing, powerful, and everytime take he takes on the Avengers, they are powerless in his presence. This is the villain we have waited 10 years for. The movie is presented like a series of short events due to the MASSIVE cast. Due to this style, you have many small groups of superheroes and sadly you don’t get enough time with some of your favorites as you would have wanted. The film lacks in action in many stretches, but the story is so good where there is so much going on, it is impossible to feel bored watching it.

As a moviegoer, this is the perfect popcorn film for audiences, escapism at it’s finest. As a comic book fan, this is everything you have waited a decade for. As a critic, there are a lot of flaws in the movie because with a 2 1/2 hour timeframe that bounces around the universe between characters, there are many things I liked about the film and many things that I didn’t like. You’ll have to wait for the spoiler talk for more detail about the issues but in a nutshell, I really liked Avengers: Infinity War, but I can’t say I loved Avengers: Infinity War.

9,"The ultimate villain of Avengers: Infinity War is going to be anyone that spoils what happens in this all-star extravaganza, the culmination of 19 films over 10 years that have made up the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As a true believer in the power of a spoiler-free experience, I’m reluctant to even talk too much about the movie here, lest I give away even a whiff of the game-changing developments worked up by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. However further you venture to read, know that Avengers: Infinity War may be the first toll of a bell signaling the end of an era but there’s still a few clangs yet to ring out.

With the action picking up two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the film wastes no time in diving into the action as big baddie Thanos (Josh Brolin, Inherent Vice) continues his quest to procure six Infinity Stones by any means necessary. With two stones in his possession by the time the title card is displayed, you get the distinct impression that Thanos isn’t going to be defeated easily no matter what brand of superhero gang sets about to stop him. Sending minions to Earth to gather stones protected by Vision (Paul Bettany, Transcendence) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch, August: Osage County), Thanos searches for the remaining gems in truly out of this world locations.

If Thanos secures all six stones in his gauntlet he’ll have power over the entire universe and be able to wipe out half the population with the snap of his very large and in charge fingers.   Never fear, though, because according to Marvel there are about 64 main characters featured and while not all of them get as much screen time as you’d think, there is often more than enough action to go around. Markus and McFeely concoct some believable ways to separate the various heroes as they unite to stop Thanos from achieving his goal. Even better, the combos of who is working with whom are surprising and often quite entertaining…but in an effort to maintain some suspense, you’ll have to see the movie to find out who teams up.

With the exception of two notable stars (again…not telling) the gang is all here, down to supporting players that haven’t been seen for a while. Even if A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow (Thanks for Sharing) get limited screen time it’s nice to see these familiar faces along the way because their appearances act like mini Easter eggs, rewarding the actors as well as devoted audience members. Arriving a little over two months after Black Panther smashed all box office records, it would have been easy to do what Justice League did after the success of Wonder Woman and give a bit more attention to a breakout star like T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman, Get on Up) but the filmmakers wisely keep things level.

The main stars that anchor the action are Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr., The Judge), Thor (Chris Hemsworth, Vacation), and Quill (Chris Pratt, Jurassic World) with some nice supporting turns from Captain America (Chris Evans, The Iceman), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, Under the Skin) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, Foxcatcher). In hindsight, it feels like the popular Guardians of the Galaxy are favored in the action ever so slightly more than a few of the veteran Avengers but watching the movie in the moment there is a greater feeling of equity. There’s little room for new characters to be introduced and when they are, like Peter Dinklage’s (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) painfully serious but ultimately silly turn, it feels like time is being taken away from the people we want to see.

Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have stuffed this prize package with an abundance of get-your-moneys-worth riches, from eye popping visual effects to spectacularly pitched action sequences. The finale is a showstopper, an all-out blitzkrieg assault that takes place in multiple places with numerous characters and still it’s never hard to follow what’s going on. It takes a special hand to guide these types of action set-pieces and their fourth film for Marvel has the Russo Brothers finding full scale power in their directing. That style in direction marries nicely with Trent Opaloch’s (Elysium) stunning cinematography that isn’t overrun by the dynamite visual effects. Alan Silvestri’s (The Croods) score is, as always, instantly recognizable and eternally heroic.

Do yourself a favor and get your bathroom breaks out before the film starts because at 156 minutes from start to finish it’s a commitment. You can’t afford to miss much, though, so even a well-timed pee break might set you back, especially in the last ten minutes. As with all Marvel movies, it goes without saying that you shouldn’t leave until the final credit has disappeared because there’s only one post-credit scene and it’s at the very end. Missing this one in particular would be a mistake.

The next Avengers movie is set for release in May 2019 and by that time two more Marvel films will have seen the light of day (Ant-Man and the Wasp in July and Captain Marvel in March 2019). Not every question is resolved by the end of Avengers: Infinity War and I’m more than interested to see what gets answered between now and next year…just do yourself a favor and see this one before anyone can spoil what happens. Don’t say I didn’t warn you…or that I let the cat out of the bag either.",Joe
9,"In the Batman universe, there are two kinds of darkness: the surface-deep emptiness of the Zack Snyder approach and Christopher Nolan’s baked-into-the-DNA aesthetic. For the stand-alone Joker, which is said to be neither prequel nor the start of a new appendage to the franchise, director Todd Phillips has come closer to the latter. This is a disturbing film, a journey into the heart of a damaged man’s psychosis. In many ways, it’s more of a horror film than an action/adventure offering. Even Nolan’s The Dark Knight, the crown jewel of the 21st century DC/Warner Brothers cinematic catalog, traced a more traditional comic book movie template than Joker. Within this genre, there has never been anything quite like it.

It’s no surprise that the best three comic book movies released in the last 20 years have deviated significantly from the film-by-numbers approach of the average superhero tale. The Dark Knight, Logan, and now Joker have all stepped into unprecedented territory. The latter two were rated R and one can make a case that The Dark Knight should have been. The films have not compromised their directors’ visions for the sake of satisfying canon. Batman and X-Men have both had so many reboots, restarts, and spin-offs that the anything-goes atmosphere allowed creativity to gestate.
In comic book parlance, Joker is an origin story. The main character, warped, failed comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), will become DC’s most infamous villain: Joker, whose previous cinematic incarnations have been portrayed by the likes of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto. (Throw in Mark Hamill if you want to include voice work.) When the movie begins, he’s a heavily medicated ex-asylum patient who is eking out a living working as a clown. He lives in a Gotham City tenement with his invalid mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Her existence revolves around two things: her love of late night TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and her obsession with her former employer, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who is running for mayor. Arthur, meanwhile, has developed an interest in another of the building’s residents, single mother Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), and things seem to be looking up…until the bottom drops out of Arthur’s world. Armed with a gun provided by a co-worker, he snaps after being bullied and beaten on a subway train by three businessmen. Off his meds, his dark nature takes over and the warped personality of “Joker” overwhelms the remnant passivity of Arthur.

Is Joker violent? Unquestionably, yes. The violence, however, is designed to shock and upset. It’s not there to quench an audience’s bloodlust or satiate the desire to see “bad” characters get their comeuppance. The body count is much smaller than in, say, John Wick 3, but each death has more impact. Blood is the currency of Arthur’s debasement, the means by which we follow his descent into hell. Some have worried about the “glorification” of violence in this film, but there’s no “glorification” evident. Unlike the average horror/slasher film, the opposite is true. Joker doesn’t ask for or expect sympathy for the main character, but it demands understanding not only of his situation but of the factors that lead to his gradual transformation from a meek clown to a manically cackling murderer and manipulator of mobs.
Joker takes place in one version of a Batman world and, as such, we are presented with various touchstones. A young Bruce Wayne makes an appearance, as does Alfred. Scenes take place in and around Arkham Asylum. Joker’s final costume pays homage to aspects of his previous appearances, with long, green hair, a clownishly made-up face, and a garishly colorful costume.

Phillips, doing a 180-degree about face from his Hangover films, isn’t shy about the debt he owes to Martin Scorsese. Not only does he borrow liberally from several Scorsese films, notably Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but he brings Robert De Niro (doing his best Johnny Carson impersonation) along for the ride. Joker’s look is vintage ‘70s, although the story transpires in 1981. (We know this from a movie marquee that advertises Zorro the Gay Blade and Blow Out.) The period setting allows for a semi-modern society without the advances in technology that have occurred in the last four decades. It’s easier to tell a story like this without computers, cell phones, and surveillance cameras on every corner.
Joker’s success is down to Joaquin Phoenix’s dedicated, uncompromising performance. With a physical transformation to match that of Christian Bale in The Machinist, Phoenix has remodeled his looks. The psychological aspects of the portrayal, delivered with at least an element of method acting, take this version of Joker to a place where only Heath Ledger has ventured. The storyline demands more from Phoenix that mere range – he must navigate the minefield of the unreliable narrator as well – and he never falters. I can’t say he will be nominated for an Oscar (which, if won, would allow him and Ledger to join Brando and De Niro as actors to win Academy Awards for playing the same character), but he should be.

When confronted with the question of a political allegory, Phillips has demurred. Nevertheless, it’s difficult to look at some of the ancillary reasons for Arthur’s mental collapse and miss the parallels: budget cuts leading to diminished social services, a lack of support for mental health, and a government more interested in fostering the interests of the “haves” over the “have nots.”

Joker represents that latest example of how the comic book canvas, if expanded and approached with an open mind and imagination, can be a fertile breeding ground for more than cookie-cutter action/adventure movies. Just as there’s a place for the battles and fights of the latest Avengers movie, there are other, less readily explored vistas for examining aspects of the human experience. Joker ventures into the darkest of these places and, although it may be difficult to “like” this film in a conventional sense, it offers a powerful and unforgettable experience that few will find easy to shake.
",James Berardinelli
7,"“Joker” is a comic book movie as filtered through the lens of gritty, brutal New York films like Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.”

Robert De Niro is even here as a snarky TV comedy show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in “The King of Comedy,” where De Niro was the delusional Rupert Pupkin, a character not far from Joaquin Phoenix’s severe, tormented Joker, aka Arthur Fleck.

It’s the early 1980s, during a notorious garbage worker strike in Gotham City. Arthur works as a professional clown, dancing and holding signs for going-out-of-business sales or singing for sick kids in a hospital.

He lives with and takes care of his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), who hopes her fleeting association with the wealthy, powerful Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) will pull them out of poverty.

Arthur also takes meds and sees a social worker weekly; the only thing said about his condition is that he tends to burst into sinister laughter at inappropriate times.

Unfortunately, after some kids steal his sign and beat him up, and a co-worker gives him a gun, he is fired. Then he’s informed that a struggling city has cut funding to social services, leaving him without support and pills.

Meanwhile, he meets Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a pretty neighbor and single mother, and takes her to see his nightclub comedy “act.” The act is videotaped and sent to Murray Franklin (De Niro), who airs it, then invites Arthur on the show.

At that point, Arthur just might have had enough.

“Joker” is filled with despair, set in a world in which the rich and powerful promise to save everyone, but honestly don’t care about anyone who’s not already rich and powerful.

On a television interview, Wayne disparages those who haven’t made something of themselves, insultingly calling them “clowns.” The turn of phrase inspires citywide rage.

In one sneeringly ironic scene, clown-masked downtrodden people on the verge of rioting protest outside a gala showing of Charlie Chaplin’s “Modern Times,” attended by the city’s elite, all laughing in delight at the exploits of a homeless clown.

Weirdly, the director of “Joker” is Todd Phillips, known for lowbrow, mostly dumb, comedies, especially the $277 million hit “The Hangover.”

But his career began with a remarkable and terrifying 1993 documentary, “Hated: GG Allin & the Murder Junkies,” about hardcore punk rocker Allin, who died at 36 after a career of doing unspeakable things onstage — either because he was angry, artistically intense or merely bonkers.
Phillips brings some of that energy to “Joker,” and Phoenix meets him halfway with his feral, ferocious, full-bodied performance.

While Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill and Jack Nicholson (at the top), Cesar Romero (in the middle) and Jared Leto (elsewhere) have gone to extremes to portray this most prominent pop culture villain, Phoenix has the luxury of not having to share the screen with Batman.

He sears into Joker’s psyche like a hot poker. Nearly skeletal, and with eyes permanently shaded by overhanging brows, he moves like a balletic contortionist spider, all limbs and big shoes and flapping bell-bottoms.

When he explodes into full-bore killer clown mode, his release is not entirely monstrous; it’s also heartbreaking.

In the comics, Batman catches Joker and puts him away, like garbage, but in “Joker” it’s the anger, hate and ignorance of humans that made him in the first place.",Jeffrey M. Anderson
8,"Since its debut a few weeks ago at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the top prize, Todd Phillips’s “Joker” has stirred up quite a tempest. Hands have been wrung about the movie’s supposed potential to inspire acts of real-life violence, and criticism of its brutal nihilism has been met with a counter-backlash, including from Phillips himself, who has been sounding off about the “far left” and “woke culture” and other threats to the ability of a murderous clown to make money unmolested. Meanwhile, the usual armies of skeptics and fans have squared off with ready-made accusations of bad faith, hypersensitivity and quasi-fascist groupthink.

We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it’s also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me?
To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. “Joker,” an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity — as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage — the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance.
It barely even works within the confines of its own genre, the comic-book movie. “Joker” is a supervillain origin story, involving a character whose big-screen résumé already includes three Oscar winners (two for other roles, but still). It’s not hard to see the appeal. The Joker, an embodiment of pure anarchy, can be played light or heavy, scary or fun or all at once. He can sneer like Jack Nicholson, snarl like Heath Ledger or … I’m still not sure what Jared Leto was doing, but never mind.
As embodied by Joaquin Phoenix, he laughs a lot — enough to ensure that no one else will. The hallmark of this “Joker” is its solemn witlessness. You might wonder how this could be the work of the same Todd Phillips who directed “The Hangover” and “Road Trip,” which have at least a reputation for being funny. The cleverest bit here is casting Robert De Niro as a late-night, Carsonesque talk-show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.” In that movie, De Niro was the crazy stalker, a talentless wannabe presuming to breathe the same air as his idol and quarry. This time out, he’s in the big chair, feeding the celebrity obsessions of Arthur Fleck.
That’s the Joker’s alter ego: a lonely, damaged man eking out an abject living as a clown-for-hire and living in a drab apartment with his mother (Frances Conroy). Phillips, who wrote the script with Scott Silver, takes us back to the bad old days of Gotham City, when work was scarce, rats were rampant and a garbage strike fouled the streets. Fleck is bullied by thieving poor kids and drunken rich guys, goaded to the point of murder by the meanness of the world. He has a crush on a neighbor (Zazie Beetz) that he thinks might be reciprocated. He keeps a notebook full of stand-up material and works up the nerve to go onstage at a nightclub open-mic night.
There’s nothing wrong with any of these plot points, or with the details that knit “Joker” into the familiar Batman world. Arthur has a connection to the Wayne family — we meet Alfred the butler and young Bruce — and also to Arkham Asylum. The problems arise when the film revs its allegorical engine and Phoenix tries to assemble a character from the tics and tropes he has been given.

Skinny, twitchy and at times startlingly graceful — Phoenix is one of the modern screen’s underrated dancers — Arthur has a physical and psychological resemblance to Freddie Quell, the misfit drifter Phoenix played in “The Master.” But he also carries the burden of being a victimized Everyman in a parable that can’t get its story straight. Arthur’s uncontrollable laughter arises from a medical condition that is possibly the result of childhood abuse. His profound alienation also arises from social inequality, the decline of civility, political corruption, television, government bureaucracy and a slew of other causes. Rich people are awful. Poor people are awful. Joker’s embrace of radical evil becomes a kind of integrity.

Or something. It’s hard to say if the muddle “Joker” makes of itself arises from confusion or cowardice, but the result is less a depiction of nihilism than a story about nothing. The look and the sound — cinematography by Lawrence Sher, cello-heavy score by Hildur Gudnadottir — connote gravity and depth, but the movie is weightless and shallow. It isn’t any fun, and it can’t be taken seriously. Is that the joke?

9,"Edgy and darkly disturbing, Joker takes flight on the wings of a sensational performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It's a complex and complete interpretation of a psychopath whose sense of being invisible is countered by violence. The pitch of the hysteria emanating from the laughter of a man camouflaged by the painted face of a clown is as unsettling as fingernails on a blackboard. Winner of the Golden Lion at the 2019 Venice Film Festival, this is the chilling backstory of Batman's greatest adversary and one of cinema's most memorable villains. While the character may come from the superhero universe, Todd Phillips' film stands alone as a pathos-filled characterization imbuing today's social dilemmas in praise of the vigilante in an anti-establishment culture. Worth seeing for Phoenix's performance alone, this is an electric shock of a movie that is both affecting and thought provoking.

We first meet Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) in his dressing room as he paints a freakish red smile over his clown face. He pulls his lips, distorts his face and the charcoal around his eyes becomes smudged from disturbed tears. He is a man in torment. As the narrative progresses, we edge our way into the cracks of his existence - his relationship with his invalid mother (Frances Conroy), his attractive neighbor (Zazie Beetz), his social worker (Sharon Washington), the man he learns is his father (Brett Cullen) and the TV host who offers him a platform (Robert De Niro). Through each story strand, the cracks and baggage that devour Arthur become more pronounced.

Phillips uses different camera perspectives to unnerve us. The soundscape is effective, too, along with the choice of songs and colour grading. Watch for the scene when Phoenix performs magic tricks to young Bruce Wayne. And the train sequence, when the flickering of the lights as the train veers through a tunnel, provides a perfect eerie backdrop for bloodshed. The violence is in your face and confronting. It is not for the squeamish. Ultimately, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix. He is astonishing.",Louise Keller
7,"Alas, the only remotely entertaining or even mildly interesting aspect of Joker is the notion that it might be so incendiary a depiction of a white man ignored by society who turns to violence that it incites real-life violence by real-life white men who think they are being ignored by society.

In a word: Ha!

To take even this lickspittle snippet of resonance away from the movie, this notion is nought but a metatextual one, not even part of the actual movie. We could say that this is ironically appropriate, if also unintentionally so. Or is it intentional? Did someone set out to make a movie that would (hopefully?) serve as a call to arms for disaffected white men?

Whatever: This pathetically ineffectual movie– as pathetically ineffectual as its protagonist — can only wish to be so dangerous.Joker is faux Scorsese. It is ersatz Christopher Nolan. It is not fit to lick the boots of either Taxi Driver or The Dark Knight, though the height of its ambition would appear to be its desperation to do so. This is a movie so dull, so obvious, that that is the most criminal thing about its portrait of a man “driven” to criminality by “society.” Oh, is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix: Mary Magdalene, Irrational Man) — soon to be the homicidal antagonist to Batman known as the Joker — sad? Is he lonely? Is his life not what he’d hoped it would be? Welcome to humanity, asshole. Deal with it.
Director — and coscreenwriter, with Scott Silver (The Finest Hours, 8 Mile) — Todd Phillips is a filmmaker whose entire “oeuvre” (I use the word loosely) has been about celebrating white-male inadequacy, about white men somehow getting away with skating through life thoroughly unengaged in anything beyond partying (see his Hangover movies), or humiliating white men who try to grow up (see his appalling Due Date). Now, Phillips is attempting to be “serious” by removing all the plausibility-denying fantasy from a comic-book villain by making a movie about him that is “realistic” and “gritty” or whatever-the-hell he thinks gives him cover for indulging male rage as a sorry-not-sorry *wink* response to an unreasonable world.
And yet: It’s still all the same-old justifying nonsense. There is nothing original here… and not because it’s about a comic-book character who has been depicted on screens large and small multiple times. Another white man who has not been handed fame and fortune and respect and sexy willing babes in return for having done absolutely fucking nothing with his life is angry. Cry us a river, pal.

Hello! When you take away the plausibility-denying comic-book fantasy… when you take away the over-the-top absurdity… when you take away the perfectly acceptable nonsensical dispatch of a reason for a clown-faced killer to terrorize a city… now you’re literally vilifying mental illness. (Phillips and Silver give Arthur a condition, in which he laughs uncontrollably in moments that are socially inappropriate, that may be the authentic pseudobulbar affect, or may be something of their own invention. Either way: No.)

Thanks, I hate it. This is not what the world needs right now.

Welcome to a visually washed-out retro Gotham, featuring overtures of late-70s, early 80s New York City — there’s a strike by sanitation workers that is causing black bags of garbage to disgustingly pile up on city streets, which actually happened in the Big Apple in 1977 and 1981. This is where I’m supposed to say that Joaquin Phoenix is “daring” and “radical” or some shit for having lost a lot of weight to play Arthur Fleck, failed stand-up comic, on-call clown for streetside promotions and children’s-ward hospital visits. I’m sure the actor pushed himself physically… but he doesn’t find anything psychologically fresh or intriguing in this character. Arthur is not happy with caring for his not-at-all-well mother (Frances Conroy: Welcome to Happiness, Stone), and he fantasizes a romance with his neighbor (Zazie Beetz [Geostorm]… and fuck this movie for treating her awesome presence even more poorly than Deadpool 2 does). It seems we are meant to automatically, reflexively feel bad for him… as if caring for blood relatives and dreaming of getting it on with people out of our league is not everyday reality for the vast majority of the human race.
Arthur has not been granted the life he wants without having to do the work to earn it… though he fantasizes about that, too, via a late-night TV talk show hosted by *checks notes* Robert De Niro’s Murray Franklin; Arthur likes to dream that Franklin’s show will see Arthur’s alleged comedic genius, invite him on, and, you know, etc. De Niro’s (Joy, The Intern) presence here might be the most inexplicable aspect of this damn movie. I am a huge De Niro fan, but he is bizarrely miscast: he simply does not have the charming, relaxing personality America wants for drifting off to sleep with the TV on in the background. This casting is likely meant to be a nod to De Niro’s King of Comedy turn, but even that suggests a willful misreading of The King of Comedy and of De Niro’s entire cinematic history. Jesus wept, no. Just no.

The real world of 2019 handed Todd Phillips a platter of easy pickin’s: income inequality (billionaire Thomas Wayne [Brett Cullen: The Runaways, Gridiron Gang], ie, Batman’s dad, is the ostensible villain here); the collapse of social services (the safety net that helps Arthur deal with his mental illness is cut); even the not-so-quiet rage of pathetically ineffectual men threatening to boil over into civil unrest. And Joker does not one thing interesting or engaging with it. It pushes no envelopes. It is not edgy in any respect. It is just… here. And it assumes that its mere existence is reason to applaud. It most definitely is not.

10,"Arthur Flick wants to be a standup comedian. Unfortunately he’s not funny and also has a condition that he laughs at inappropriate points. He’s got a lot of problems, especially when they cut funding for his therapist and he’s taken off all his medication all at once. This is not the Joker as he rises to power, instead this is the Joker as he slowly becomes himself in this very intense character piece into a mentally deranged individual.

This movie is about power. The power to move people or the power to control people. In Gotham City, the rich have all the power. They have the ability to suddenly cut the funding of the poor people looking for therapy. They have the power to hide in their gated mansions or turn people away simply because they’re poor. It shows how one man, with absolutely nothing, learns to take his own power back. Of course, being this isn’t a movie about a hero, or even an anti-hero, but this is the first supervillain movie I think I’ve seen. Venom, doesn’t count, he’s an anti-hero in that film. I might count Barry Lyndon though…

This is a movie that took me completely by surprise. It’s not an action movie, like pretty much every other superhero movie, and goes straight in between drama and psychological thriller. It’s poignant, another thing that seems to be missing from most other movies with supervillains in them. It’s not like any movie I’ve seen, actually, whether having heroes or not. It’s an important film, that’s also something I would never have expected from a film based on the most off-the-wall-bonkers insane super-criminal that Batman has to face off with. This film has meaning. It’s important. And everyone old enough to see an R-rated movie should probably give it a watch. This isn’t just another film, but a story of how far a man is willing to go when he sees the injustice all around him.

Still, I wouldn’t say Joker should be anyone’s hero (again this is a supervillain movie, we aren’t meant to idolize the main character). Especially not the people living in Gotham City. But, at the same time, I know why people follow him. He’s pure chaos incarnate, he’ll kill you just for a laugh, and some people “just want to watch the world burn,” as Alfred put it in the Dark Knight. And the Joker is the only person who can show you the world burning at almost every given time. Of course, most of those murders only ever make sense to him, except in this movie it all makes sense. The director and Joaquin Phoenix makes it make sense because that’s how far into the Joker’s psyche that we delve through the course of the film.

Also, I want to talk about the Killing Joke for just a bit. This is the ultimate Joker comic and shows one version of his origin story, but as you read and reread it you might start to notice a few things, such as the same characters appear to show up again and again, but in different roles, or how one panel might directly contradict the next, or a panel pages later. You start to notice that there’s cracks in the story itself, and it becomes more and more clear that Joker is really just making it all up (or he’s just crazy, definitely one of those…). This is because the Joker doesn’t have a true origin story. It’s why the story keeps changing in the Dark Knight whenever that particular Joker said “you know how I got these scars…” There’s similar things here, though the film does tell you that one specific storyline was completely made up, after they did that I started wondering just how much of the rest of this story is really happening. Did Joker kill those three guys on the train or did he just watch it on the news and then make believe he did? It’s questions like that which plague me as I watch through this film but ultimately, just like with the Killing Joke, it doesn’t actually matter what the Joker’s origins are. He’s more like an elemental, pure chaos incarnate, and this shows us one way he may have become the way he is, but it’s not the only way. Joker prefers the multiple choice origin story.",Nathaniel R. Mitchell
9,"Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a man on the edge.  He works as a clown, takes care of his mother (Frances Conroy), and is trying to be a stand-up comedian while dealing with multiple mental illnesses.  Cut off from his funded healthcare and medication, Arthur suddenly finds himself unemployed and questioning everything he thought he knew was true about his life when tragedy strikes…and it could be the best thing that ever happened to Arthur.
Directed by Todd Phillips (who also helped write the film with Scott Silver), Joker is a comic book drama.  The film is based on the Batman villain and received criticism upon its release due to the film’s violent tone and idolization of the character.  The film was released at the Venice Film Festival where it won the Golden Lion.  The film was released to largely critical praise and a massive box-office release.  The film led the Academy Award nominations winning for Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score with nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.  The film also received a Razzie nomination for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property.

I am a comic book fan, and Joker upset non-comic book fans and comic book fans alike due to the conversations that swirled around it.  It is in those conversations and the tone of the movie which helps elevate Joker above a lot of its contemporaries…but it also can kind of blur the film’s message.
The movie is basically a comic book movie at heart…it has a comic book “villain” and involvement of Bruce Wayne, his father, his mother, and even Alfred Pennyworth.  This is where the comic book ties almost end.  You have a movie that is primarily a drama about mental illness and the failings of the system linked arm and arm with this comic book set-up.  For people who believe that comic book movies are popcorn and fun, this diminishes some of the message because they might not see it.  For those who want a comic book movie, an art house presentation of a classic villain without the flash and visuals of something like Avengers or even The Dark Knight.

The movie is really a condemnation about the treatment of mental illness, and the even more current trend of elevating people into heroes without considering the consequences or if they can handle it.  Arthur knows he’s sick, people recognize he’s sick, his meds aren’t working anymore, he’s been cut off from counseling, and he has easy access to a weapon…it is a bad combination.  The people turn the subway killer into a hero and this further inflates Arthur’s delusions that it is a sign of acceptance.  It’s a vicious circle that feels appropriate in this day and age where YouTube stars shoot to fame (and a number have been taken down by past digressions).
The film works because of Joaquin Phoenix.  The character and script borrowed heavily from Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver but it is almost what happens to Bickle after the end of the film.  While Bickle wasn’t getting mental help and did what he did as a result, Joker was getting help and the failure of that help contributed to the bad results.

Phoenix has great back-up in Robert DeNiro as the Johnny Carson-esque talk show host and Frances Conroy as Fleck’s equally disturbed mother.  Zazie Beetz has a small but important role to demonstrate the depths of Fleck’s condition and the movie also features new performers portraying classic comic book characters Brett Cullen (Thomas Wayne), Carrie Louise Putrello (Martha Wayne), Douglas Hodge (Alfred Pennyworth), and Dante Pereira-Olson (Bruce Wayne).
The movie has a great throwback look that also mimics Taxi Driver and Scorsese’s early films.  It gets the grimy horror and dirty look that made those movies successful.  This combines with a soundtrack emphasizing the character’s obsessions and sicknesses.  A big criticism was drawn by the use of convicted pedophile Gary Glitter’s “Rock ‘n’ Roll (Part 2)”, but I would feel more critical of this if I didn’t hear high school and college bands play it all the time without more judgment.

Joker will not be for everyone (and it definitely is not for kids or younger viewers).  The whole film is presented as a possible mind-game if you look at in some ways (especially considering the last scene in a very American Psycho-esque moment).  It is the type of movie that challenges you while watching it because you have to keep recognizing that you are watching a film about a mentally ill character.  Joaquin Phoenix is hypnotic in the film and gives one of his best performances which both enhances the story and builds more criticism for the idolization of killers without looking at the faults and potential solutions to prevent tragedies from happening.  What do you do when the pills don’t work or stop working, what do you do with a person who could potentially commit a crime but is on the street because he or she hasn’t?  Those are questions posed by Joker that society needs to answer…and at least Joker is spawning more conversation about it.",JP Roscoe
8,"Arthur Fleck laughs, sometimes inappropriately, so that he may not cry.   Or kill.   Even if Joker were not an origins story about Batman's greatest nemesis, Joker would still be a gritty and riveting tale of an ordinary man teetering on the edge of sanity.    Borrowing in spirit from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker's Arthur Fleck is a professional clown engaged in daily conflict with his demons.    He was once institutionalized, he regularly visits an overworked social worker in a messy office, and takes seven different medications to battle his various psychological ailments.    As Joker opens, he is mugged while performing a sidewalk gig holding up a ""going out of business"" sign.    Things don't get any better for him.

Arthur takes care of his ailing mother, who once worked for Thomas Wayne (Cullen), the billionaire industrialist and father of Bruce who is running for mayor of early 1980's Gotham, which is in the midst of a sanitation workers' strike and is overflowing with bags of garbage left untouched on city streets.    Tensions in Gotham are escalating to nightmarish proportions, and this mirrors the tensions within Arthur himself.    A co-worker sells Arthur a gun so he can protect himself at his gigs, which is akin to giving an arsonist gasoline and a match.

Arthur's hellish life drifts into focus.   He finds a measure of relief in a budding romance with his neighbor Sophie (Beetz), who smiles at him in the elevator and doesn't appear to be turned off by his generally creepy demeanor.    When faced with a scary situation or potential conflict, Arthur laughs maniacally and uncontrollably.    He attributes it to his past physical and psychological trauma, and he isn't wrong.

How Arthur ties into, or doesn't tie into the Wayne family is soon explained.    We see how, in Arthur's world, not everything is what it seems.    His fragile state of mind leaves open the question as to what is real and what isn't.    One night on the subway, Arthur kills three yuppie creeps and finds elation in the act.   It is the release he has sought, and soon finds violence is his nature.    Through all this, we still sympathize with him, because while he clearly grows into a psychopath, we have to suspect it is due at least in part to past abuse and an altogether sad existence.  

Nothing Joaquin Phoenix has done before prepared me for his excellent work here.    I've enjoyed and appreciated him in Gladiator, Walk the Line, The Sisters Brothers, We Own the Night, and a few other films throughout his long career.    Other times, I wasn't much moved by him because I couldn't get a sense of who was inside.    He knew the words, but not the music.   His Arthur Fleck is sad, monosyllabic, inarticulate, and full of seething rage.    He cannot verbalize fully how trapped he feels, how his afflictions have hindered him, and how cannot break free without resorting to relenting to his crueler, violent nature.  

The Gotham of Todd Phillips' film is filthy, ugly, and unsightly.   The skies are gray.   Even the interiors are gray and dirty.   There isn't much sunshine, and what little exists is seen through windows from the inside.    There is much happiness to be found here, but the effect isn't depressing, but instead adds atmosphere.    Arthur's dreams of stand-up comedy fame intersect with TV talk show host Murray Franklin (DeNiro), whom Arthur idolizes.   Murray's show, which resembles Johnny Carson's Tonight Show right down to the multi-colored curtain from which Murray and his guests emerge, attempts to bring at least some semblance of joy to the increasingly turbulent Gotham.   It also attracts people like Arthur to hang around its periphery yearning to belong.

There are an abundance of reports and columns concerning the violence in Joker and how it stigmatizes the mentally ill as repugnant and violent.    I don't agree that Joker is any more violent than other films.   (Apparently no such uproar was made about Rambo: Last Blood, which was almost violence porn).    Joker has its share of blood and violence, but the violent scenes are isolated and contain their own individual reasons for their existence, most as a tragic form of release for Arthur.
Joker is Arthur's individual story, and doesn't purport to be an allegory about society's treatment of the mentally ill or how the mentally ill are more prone to violent acts.    Joker is instead a story told with superb craftmanship and anchored by a Phoenix performance which hits all the right notes about an odd, tormented, yet still sympathetic character.    The story of The Joker is so fully and expertly realized that I hope it isn't watered down with an unnecessary sequel.",Doug Fisher
5,"As a villain in Batman’s rogues’ gallery, Joker has been returned to repeatedly. He’s the classic archenemy, with a nuclear psychological profile that makes him a viable threat and a thematic counterpoint to the Caped Crusader’s own dalliance with insanity. In film and television, Joker has been portrayed by a number of talented actors, each giving the part a unique spin while still tending to the traditional madness of the character as it exists in the Batman universe. Co-writer/director Todd Phillips seems to be tired of the superhero norm, delivering “Joker,” an origin story for the Clown Prince of Crime that slowly makes its way into an abyss of mental illness, refusing the lure of Batman to remain with the villain as he samples the cruelties of the world, helping him to become the sadistic madman known to all. Phillips has a big idea for “Joker,” but he doesn’t make much of a movie with it, with the possibilities of the feature more enticing than the realities of it.
In the early 1980s, Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) is trying to keep on grip on things while struggling with mental health issues, including uncontrollable laughter when his anxiety rises. He’s a clown by trade, but life in Gotham City is no laughing matter, with Arthur assaulted on the job, only to return home to care for his sickly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Arthur is heavily medicated and holds on to a dream of stand-up comedy, hoping to appear on “The Murray Franklin Show,” finally offered a chance to meet the late-night talk show host (Robert De Niro), wowing him with his performance skills. But the days only grow darker for Arthur, who deals poorly with the loss of his job, while a moment of subway harassment leads to a triple murder, which turns the clown-painted aggressor into a symbol for the city’s poor and forgotten, finally giving Arthur the bloodthirsty audience he’s been craving all along.

Gotham City is in trouble. There’s a garbage strike, permitting rats to rule the streets, and crime is common, creating a battleground for a guy like Arthur. He lives with his mother, trying to be a dutiful son, earning a living and listening to Penny’s pleas to get into contact with her former employer, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), the egocentric billionaire who’s running for public office. Arthur’s life is his apartment, taking time out from stewing in his own filth to surf on his imagination, conjuring visions of appearing with Murray Franklin, charming his audience. Arthur even has an empowerment dance, enjoying a private sway now and then, enjoying the freedom of his dreams, which offer a stark contrast to the reality of his life. Joker isn’t formed at the beginning of the picture, as Phillips (with co-writer Scott Silver) endeavors to draw out the process for as long as possible, more fascinated with Arthur’s brewing violence than the iconic end result of weaponized insanity.
There could be a lot more to “Joker,” which mostly remains a character study, staying up close with Arthur has he experiences the world’s heartlessness. The system has lost its funding, severing Arthur from his dispassionate therapist and his medicine. He’s unable to stay employed, losing his job as a clown for hire due to a poor decision to bring a gun into a children’s hospital. And he’s curious about Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a single mother who lives nearby and shows interest in Arthur’s special sense of humor. Phillips lingers on Arthur’s pain for extended periods of screentime, particularly in love with the laugh, which isn’t a gleeful release of craziness, but a sickly, throat-tearing squeal that acts up when the battered man loses control. The goal of “Joker” is to make the audience as uncomfortable as possible, and the laugh, the sheer excess of it, is an effective tool for the filmmaker. But after that, Phillips doesn’t have much, finding the screenplay one-note after introductions are made, while the feature’s lone mystery (involving the identity of Arthur’s father) isn’t captivating, offered only as perfunctory plot in a picture that’s purely about corrosive ambiance (though gorgeously photographed by Lawrence Sher).
“Joker” moves aimlessly from scene to scene, weaving in and out of reality to a point where nothing on screen can be trusted, though a true dreamlike odyssey is avoided. There’s graphic violence, with Phillips recreating the Bernard Goetz subway vigilante experience to bring Joker into the light, inspiring Gotham City to rise up with fists and clown masks to take down the 1%, though the bigness of the cause is never fully realized. And while Phoenix commits to the part, he’s recycling previous performances, once again doing unhinged with head-quaking fury. As for Batman, there’s some connective tissue to future superhero war, but Phillips isn’t here to play up Joker’s role in the D.C. Universe, he wants to watch it burn for two hours, putting his own stamp of nihilism and gut-rot on the flamboyant character. It’s a valiant effort, especially in brighter comic book entertainment times, but “Joker” does one thing and nothing more, delivering more drag than excitement.",Brian Orndorf
8,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is memorable, and this villain origin story is written nicely...

Among the many villains Batman has faced, one easily stands out: the wicked clown-faced criminal known as the Joker. This is a character we have seen plenty of times over the years, portrayed in different styles by multiple actors. There's the comical presentation of Joker by Cesar Romero in the 1960s Batman television series, and even, for that matter, the silly Joker in The Lego Batman Movie recently. For something mildly dark, there's Jack Nicholson's Joker in the 1989 Batman movie and Mark Hamill voicing the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series in TV in the 1990s. Then, if you really want an ultra dark Joker, look no further than Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance in The Dark Knight in 2008. With such a high bar set, it would be a challenge to reach the same level of excellence that Ledger achieved.

Now we have Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, who also fits in the same category of ultra dark. Obviously, the first question is whether Phoenix or Ledger is better as the Joker. Honestly, I find it hard to decide. It's not just because they're both great in their own way. It's also because these actors portray different stages of the Joker's descent to evil. Whereas Ledger's Joker is in the deepest part of the abyss, Phoenix's Joker is at the edge of it and already sliding down slowly towards its center. It's almost like comparing apples and oranges, so I say we just proceed to look at Phoenix's Joker closely without further comparisons.

Phoenix plays a man in Gotham City named Arthur Fleck. He appears at first to be like any ordinary person, with a job (as a party clown), a place to live (a rundown apartment), and a living family member (his mother Penny, played by Frances Conroy). But look closely and you'll see someone who is disturbed. A mental health specialist may note Arthur's limited emotional expression, wide-eyed stare, sharing of negative thoughts, and involuntary laughter not matching the context of the situation. So yeah, he's pretty damaged from the moment we first see him. But you know what else is messed up? His circumstances. Just when you think he may be able to barely hold it together while going through life, bad luck strikes multiple times.

Basically, a series of unfortunate events pushes this already fragile man to the brink. The descent suddenly quickens after Arthur commits murder, which may not have been a planned first-degree incident, but it still sets two things into motion: a police investigation that soon heads his way, and a citywide revolution by the masses against the wealthy class. By this time, we may feel a bit of sorrow and sympathy for Arthur, because it's clear that society has treated him unfairly. The same could apply to many other residents of Gotham City struggling to make ends meet.

As the story proceeds, Arthur continues to be pushed around. More things happen that trigger anger towards those around him, further feeding the notion that society is cruel and working against him, never for him. This leads to further moral decline. There are also a few more killings, which are shocking not just because of the amount of on-screen blood shown but also because of how unexpected they are. And at just the right moment, he puts on a frightening clown persona and fully transforms into the Joker.

Although there is a plot in this film, it's not the primary focus. The story can be described simply as a series of events that influence the main character and lead him down the path of evil transformation. It's not one of those movies that has plot twists and an epic climax. In fact, the climax in this movie is one that you'll likely not notice to be a climax until after it's over. So Joker is not a plot-based movie. Rather, it's primarily a fascinating character study that dives deeper into a familiar fictional character.

There's another secondary element worth mentioning: social commentary. Beyond the world of Gotham City, this film presents a microcosm of the society we live in. Like the real world, Gotham City has a large wealth gap between the haves and have-nots, plus associated poverty, unemployment, and crime. The film also reminds us how selfish we can be sometimes, and that has unfair consequences for certain other individuals. That in turn reminds us that the concept of the villain is relative. Traditionally, Batman is on the side of good and the Joker is on the side of evil. But in this film, it seems Gotham City is the villain and the Joker is the one trying to make things right in whatever circumstances. This is another reason I appreciate seeing things from the Joker's perspective.

Obviously, this is not a superhero movie, which is something you see a lot these days. Rather, it's a supervillain movie, providing a new take on an established genre. I definitely appreciated this movie for doing something dramatically different and doing it well. It was fun seeing the Joker's life before Batman came along. That's not to say there's no indirect reference to Batman, because the young Bruce Wayne, who will eventually become Batman, appears briefly in this film, as a way to connect the Joker back to Batman and to better see how one influenced the other. Again, another neat take on a familiar story.

Now, will we see more origin films centering on superhero villains? I say maybe. If this film is any indication of what's possible, I expect more will be coming along, and they will really expand the already huge genre of superhero movies.",Anthony
6,"The beauty of films about superheroes and cultural icons, and/or adapted from popular works, is that you’ve got a ready-made audience, but more importantly, potential viewers know what game they’re stepping into. Joker, for good or ill, certainly wants the former, but is playing rather fast and loose with the latter.

Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled guy, and while he has an unequal share of everyman problems, he also has a lot of prescriptions for his psychological issues. He also exists in a Gotham City that is seemingly falling apart. A garbage worker strike is causing problems you can easily imagine, and a budget crisis sees the city cutting services left and right.
Part of the overall “construction” of Joker stems from Arthur’s work as a clown, and his dream of being a stand-up comic, but it mostly comes down to the system endlessly flailing at a guy after taking away his meds. None of this is helped by inserting Arthur into a foreboding urban backdrop that has the fight between the haves and the have nots leaving the city crumbling under its own weight.

The film paints a vivid, and even a beautifully dark portrait, and at times Phoenix is a wonder to watch, but in any sense in which films are to be judged above and beyond a series of pictures Joker leaves a lot to be desired. It isn’t, except in the utterly boring sense that it technically is, about Joker at all, and writer/director Todd Phillips belabors every aspect of his narrative as though he is imparting some glorious and esoteric truth upon the masses he doesn’t think much of.
Arthur isn’t simply beaten down by the system, living a depressing life in virtual squalor, he is literally beaten down, harassed nonsensically by his boss, and given a social worker who doesn’t listen to him and shrugs off the insane ramblings in his journal. He isn’t vaguely “crazed” or have psychopathic tendencies, he has a dozen drugs trying to keep his varied (and unnamed) psychological conditions in check, hallucinates, and has pseudobulbar affect so we can get his laughing on board. He isn’t simply a victim, he’s a victim a hundred times over, and ultimately becomes the victim of everyone, and from angles even he couldn’t see coming.
While this alternate Joker origin, the one in which he isn’t a “villain” already and has no ability to be any kind of mastermind, criminal or otherwise, is one that dangles a lot of potential, our story here negates everything the Joker has always been, and even its own effort by the time it’s done. Where Joker has long managed to force audiences to question, or at least discuss, the madness inherent in ethics and morality while putting a spectacularly creepy face on dastardly machinations, this Joker transcends evil and even villainy altogether.
In much the way Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises loses itself under the weight of its societal klaxon, becoming only accidentally a Batman film, Joker is more concerned with delivering its punchline (in an all-time great among stagy, ineffective scenes) than a character that makes sense or a road that ultimately leads anywhere. The scenery is lovely and if Phoenix is, in fact, portraying precisely what Phillips wanted then he’s a genius, but pure crazy is boring and funneling it through a kind of hyperbolic ethos so you can make a political statement as daring as “leaving mental patients to their own devices is bad” doesn’t change that.",Marc Eastman
8,"Possibly the most hyped-up release in recent memory (aside from Endgame, ‘cause, c’mon, nothing’s gonna top a tentpole Disney release, amiright?), Joker was said to provide an already storied character with the appropriately-vaunted cinematic origin story he has so deserved all these years. And we certainly get something along those lines, as we watch young (I guess…more on that in a bit) Arthur as he suffers from an uncomfortable laughing condition and attempts to make it big as a stand-up comedian. He runs up against the wall of late-silver/early-bronze age Gotham City, replete with crime, corruption, and bad times for well-meaning folks like Arthur. As he’s pushed further and further by the darkness around him, he begins to increasingly resemble the Crown Prince of Crime that we all know and love today.

While not a complete mess by any stretch, I can’t say that I enjoyed Joker all that much. Joaquin Phoenix is a damned beast, and his lead performance helped keep me going during periods of doubt and boredom. Beyond him, though, there was little to outwardly like. I dug the fact that the world held a dingy, oppressive atmosphere, not unlike the New York that kept 42nd Street alive and kicking in its filthy prime, but it became a bit much, especially when it led to the sacrifice of rich or varied colors. (It ain’t Snyder’s Gotham, but it’s also far from Jenkins’ Themyscira.) The script, while not being nearly as bad as previous DC offerings, is still trite and copies handily from other films, like The King of Comedy. Everything is very on-the-nose, and motivations spring up suddenly, always with a just-so attitude.

What really hampers things, though, is the idea that the film was even necessary to begin with. I have no problem with providing Phoenix some prime steak ‘pon which to cut his teeth and ply his trade (people ply their trades on steaks, right?), but here it’s in the service of needlessly telling the story of how a villain came to be. In every prior incarnation of the character I’ve seen, the Joker’s either just shown up as-is, preformed somewhere in the primordial past, or he’s given a modicum of a backstory, usually involving him being a particularly loony gangster or criminal who rose through the ranks by dint of his madness, verve, and brutality. This lack of a wholly humanizing angle has helped keep the character mysterious, frightening, everything a top-class villain should be. Here, we see a guy who quite literally wanted to be a clown, only to have the world spit in his face, to which he responded by turning into a vicious, seemingly nihilistic madman. Sure. Can you see how this might water down his legend, even just a little bit?

Worse, I didn’t feel the film was all that convincing or compelling. Sure, Arthur was repeatedly dealt a rough hand, but his antagonists are all cardboard and hyperbolic, never feeling genuine, and his reaction, frankly, rings rather more short-sighted and immediate than fully understandable. I couldn’t find myself empathizing with Arthur for very long, ‘cause he’d just go and do something weird or violent and then go along his merry way. It’s not a constant deluge of darkness that turns him, but a punctuated series of itemized, well-spaced, regularly-paced steps. Shit, I’d rather remember him just wanting to be a criminal and letting his innate malevolence lead the way, even though that version of his origin is admittedly potentially less interesting and/or satisfying. Plus, there’s the whole question of just how old Arthur is supposed to be, given the time period and how we know things shake out in the DC Universe (I mean, were one to gauge it by Phoenix’s appearance, the Joker would be nearing retirement age when he takes on Batman in the coming decades), which took me out of things just that tiny bit more.

Credit where it’s due to writer/producer/director Todd Phillips, he did a decent-enough job in forging an atmospheric and heavy film, but it just plain didn’t work for me, especially when he gets on his “we live in a society”-style bullshit as he goes on. It’s an impressive move for the guy who showed us just how easy it was to drive an alright comedic idea into the ground with only three movies, but I can’t call it a complete success.
Cuck, on the other hand, kinda surprised me with how well it turned out and portrayed a similar story. Here, young Ronald (everybody calls him Ronnie, but I’m just gonna go ahead and call him Ronald, ‘cause I’m an asshole like that) finds himself in quite the bad emotional spot: The son of a late soldier, he can’t enlist in the army due to psychological issues; he lives under the thumb of his manipulative mother (trust me, the years we didn’t see are likely a much darker supervillain origin story than Joker could ever hope to be); he’s got a hard time finding and/or holding a job, what him thinking he’s above certain work and his inability to fully get along with certain others; he’s bad with women, thanks to both the heavy hand of his mother during his upbringing and a (likely consequently) negative view toward women; and he can’t help but notice just how well certain other people are doing, namely those of other races. Like many of his situation, he’s increasingly turning to the internet for bolstering, be it from right-wing nutjobs on YouTube (or, at least, the equivalent platform invented for the film) or from the ladies of good ol’ pornography. As he digs deeper into the rabbit hole, even starting up his own ranty channel extolling the virtues of the American Dream and condemning all those liberal “cucks” who’re ruining things for patriots like him, he gets involved with the online sex show produced by his comely neighbor. Little does he realize just how precarious his mental state truly is, and how far off the deep end he can go.

Immediately, I was struck by the humanity exhibited in Zachary Ray Sherman’s Ronald: As an avowed left-wing ninny myself (I think I’ve made many of my views clear in previous posts, so no gasps, kids), I expected to just look down my nose at the little bastard, but I often found myself actually feeling for the kid. We see that he is willing to try at life, even if he almost always turns his back in the end, and some of his breaks do indeed seem pretty rough. Although he’s clearly got something of a daddy complex and some mildly arrested development, the film shows that he is still the product of his own decisions, that his hole is deepened more by his reactive choices to his circumstances than the circumstances themselves. Sherman plays the part just as punchably as the character deserves, but he leaves enough naivete and pain in there to ensure that we never fully scoff him away. I assumed the right-wing loonery we’d see would be at least slightly on-the-nose and obvious, and it definitely is, but it’s given the context that allows it to feel natural, the result of Ronald’s conscious and unconscious choices, and his delivery of the classic talking points – we’re talking your antisemitism, your xenophobia, your homo- and transphobia, your uber-militaristic nationalism, those sorts of things – is natural enough to not come across like a polished talking head, but rather like a downtrodden loser who’s regurgitating them while clinging to their underlying philosophies in the hopes of staving off utter desolation. Even better, it’s clear the film thinks rather lowly of these ideas, unlike the relative ambivalence exhibited by Joker.

What really sold me on the narrative, though, is the way Ronald finally discovers just how low he can sink. He becomes infatuated with his neighbor, played by the always-engaging and -lovely Monique Parent, and sets out to woo her in his own bedraggled way. This leads to him joining in on her internet-based sexcapades, always as the put-upon guy who’s shown up by another, all while he’s tasked with masturbating to the scene before him. If you haven’t caught the hint yet, he’s playing the part of the cuckold. The cuck. Worse, he doesn’t even realize it, what with his delusions and the fact that he really only understands the term as a blanket insult, the way “idiot” and “dick” have lost their original meanings over the past decades’ use (I admit to dropping some hard Fs and Rs in my day in similar fashions, never intending to invoke the proper definitional implications of the words). When he finds out what it really means, and that he has been coerced into being one, you can see the twigs snap behind his eyes. It’s quite a shift, and credit goes to the filmmakers for employing this revelatory methodology, as it’s pretty effective.

So while Arthur’s descent isn’t quite as genuine-feeling as it could have been, Ronald’s reeks of real-world angst and sadness. You can tell he’s clutching to the only things that have made sense in his life, accentuating the vehement reactions against the seemingly opposing forces in the vain hope of maintaining his heroes’ status quo – and his own by association. At the end, you feel the mixed feelings you should: You shake your head not just because some asshat did some dastardly shit, but also because of the potential that was needlessly wasted. I never got that feeling whilst watching the Joker take his bows and dance about, but Ronnie brought out just the right amount of sympathy without forcing me to abandon my own beliefs.

While there are some issues with Cuck, like some overactive editing and a fairly dime-sized narrative turning point, I can’t help but warm to it. If you really wanna see a mind descend into the depths and take on its perceived transgressors with hatred and violence, do yourself a favor and opt for Cuck, it’s got a better heart and a stronger head on its shoulders. If you need to budget and the polish, Joker isn’t truly bad, so you aren’t likely to make too big a mistake here.
