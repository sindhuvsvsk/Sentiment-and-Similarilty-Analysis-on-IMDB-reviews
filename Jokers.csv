9,"In the Batman universe, there are two kinds of darkness: the surface-deep emptiness of the Zack Snyder approach and Christopher Nolan’s baked-into-the-DNA aesthetic. For the stand-alone Joker, which is said to be neither prequel nor the start of a new appendage to the franchise, director Todd Phillips has come closer to the latter. This is a disturbing film, a journey into the heart of a damaged man’s psychosis. In many ways, it’s more of a horror film than an action/adventure offering. Even Nolan’s The Dark Knight, the crown jewel of the 21st century DC/Warner Brothers cinematic catalog, traced a more traditional comic book movie template than Joker. Within this genre, there has never been anything quite like it.

It’s no surprise that the best three comic book movies released in the last 20 years have deviated significantly from the film-by-numbers approach of the average superhero tale. The Dark Knight, Logan, and now Joker have all stepped into unprecedented territory. The latter two were rated R and one can make a case that The Dark Knight should have been. The films have not compromised their directors’ visions for the sake of satisfying canon. Batman and X-Men have both had so many reboots, restarts, and spin-offs that the anything-goes atmosphere allowed creativity to gestate.
In comic book parlance, Joker is an origin story. The main character, warped, failed comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), will become DC’s most infamous villain: Joker, whose previous cinematic incarnations have been portrayed by the likes of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto. (Throw in Mark Hamill if you want to include voice work.) When the movie begins, he’s a heavily medicated ex-asylum patient who is eking out a living working as a clown. He lives in a Gotham City tenement with his invalid mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Her existence revolves around two things: her love of late night TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and her obsession with her former employer, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who is running for mayor. Arthur, meanwhile, has developed an interest in another of the building’s residents, single mother Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), and things seem to be looking up…until the bottom drops out of Arthur’s world. Armed with a gun provided by a co-worker, he snaps after being bullied and beaten on a subway train by three businessmen. Off his meds, his dark nature takes over and the warped personality of “Joker” overwhelms the remnant passivity of Arthur.

Is Joker violent? Unquestionably, yes. The violence, however, is designed to shock and upset. It’s not there to quench an audience’s bloodlust or satiate the desire to see “bad” characters get their comeuppance. The body count is much smaller than in, say, John Wick 3, but each death has more impact. Blood is the currency of Arthur’s debasement, the means by which we follow his descent into hell. Some have worried about the “glorification” of violence in this film, but there’s no “glorification” evident. Unlike the average horror/slasher film, the opposite is true. Joker doesn’t ask for or expect sympathy for the main character, but it demands understanding not only of his situation but of the factors that lead to his gradual transformation from a meek clown to a manically cackling murderer and manipulator of mobs.
Joker takes place in one version of a Batman world and, as such, we are presented with various touchstones. A young Bruce Wayne makes an appearance, as does Alfred. Scenes take place in and around Arkham Asylum. Joker’s final costume pays homage to aspects of his previous appearances, with long, green hair, a clownishly made-up face, and a garishly colorful costume.

Phillips, doing a 180-degree about face from his Hangover films, isn’t shy about the debt he owes to Martin Scorsese. Not only does he borrow liberally from several Scorsese films, notably Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but he brings Robert De Niro (doing his best Johnny Carson impersonation) along for the ride. Joker’s look is vintage ‘70s, although the story transpires in 1981. (We know this from a movie marquee that advertises Zorro the Gay Blade and Blow Out.) The period setting allows for a semi-modern society without the advances in technology that have occurred in the last four decades. It’s easier to tell a story like this without computers, cell phones, and surveillance cameras on every corner.
Joker’s success is down to Joaquin Phoenix’s dedicated, uncompromising performance. With a physical transformation to match that of Christian Bale in The Machinist, Phoenix has remodeled his looks. The psychological aspects of the portrayal, delivered with at least an element of method acting, take this version of Joker to a place where only Heath Ledger has ventured. The storyline demands more from Phoenix that mere range – he must navigate the minefield of the unreliable narrator as well – and he never falters. I can’t say he will be nominated for an Oscar (which, if won, would allow him and Ledger to join Brando and De Niro as actors to win Academy Awards for playing the same character), but he should be.

When confronted with the question of a political allegory, Phillips has demurred. Nevertheless, it’s difficult to look at some of the ancillary reasons for Arthur’s mental collapse and miss the parallels: budget cuts leading to diminished social services, a lack of support for mental health, and a government more interested in fostering the interests of the “haves” over the “have nots.”

Joker represents that latest example of how the comic book canvas, if expanded and approached with an open mind and imagination, can be a fertile breeding ground for more than cookie-cutter action/adventure movies. Just as there’s a place for the battles and fights of the latest Avengers movie, there are other, less readily explored vistas for examining aspects of the human experience. Joker ventures into the darkest of these places and, although it may be difficult to “like” this film in a conventional sense, it offers a powerful and unforgettable experience that few will find easy to shake.
",James Berardinelli
7,"“Joker” is a comic book movie as filtered through the lens of gritty, brutal New York films like Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.”

Robert De Niro is even here as a snarky TV comedy show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in “The King of Comedy,” where De Niro was the delusional Rupert Pupkin, a character not far from Joaquin Phoenix’s severe, tormented Joker, aka Arthur Fleck.

It’s the early 1980s, during a notorious garbage worker strike in Gotham City. Arthur works as a professional clown, dancing and holding signs for going-out-of-business sales or singing for sick kids in a hospital.

He lives with and takes care of his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), who hopes her fleeting association with the wealthy, powerful Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) will pull them out of poverty.

Arthur also takes meds and sees a social worker weekly; the only thing said about his condition is that he tends to burst into sinister laughter at inappropriate times.

Unfortunately, after some kids steal his sign and beat him up, and a co-worker gives him a gun, he is fired. Then he’s informed that a struggling city has cut funding to social services, leaving him without support and pills.

Meanwhile, he meets Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a pretty neighbor and single mother, and takes her to see his nightclub comedy “act.” The act is videotaped and sent to Murray Franklin (De Niro), who airs it, then invites Arthur on the show.

At that point, Arthur just might have had enough.

“Joker” is filled with despair, set in a world in which the rich and powerful promise to save everyone, but honestly don’t care about anyone who’s not already rich and powerful.

On a television interview, Wayne disparages those who haven’t made something of themselves, insultingly calling them “clowns.” The turn of phrase inspires citywide rage.

In one sneeringly ironic scene, clown-masked downtrodden people on the verge of rioting protest outside a gala showing of Charlie Chaplin’s “Modern Times,” attended by the city’s elite, all laughing in delight at the exploits of a homeless clown.

Weirdly, the director of “Joker” is Todd Phillips, known for lowbrow, mostly dumb, comedies, especially the $277 million hit “The Hangover.”

But his career began with a remarkable and terrifying 1993 documentary, “Hated: GG Allin & the Murder Junkies,” about hardcore punk rocker Allin, who died at 36 after a career of doing unspeakable things onstage — either because he was angry, artistically intense or merely bonkers.
Phillips brings some of that energy to “Joker,” and Phoenix meets him halfway with his feral, ferocious, full-bodied performance.

While Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill and Jack Nicholson (at the top), Cesar Romero (in the middle) and Jared Leto (elsewhere) have gone to extremes to portray this most prominent pop culture villain, Phoenix has the luxury of not having to share the screen with Batman.

He sears into Joker’s psyche like a hot poker. Nearly skeletal, and with eyes permanently shaded by overhanging brows, he moves like a balletic contortionist spider, all limbs and big shoes and flapping bell-bottoms.

When he explodes into full-bore killer clown mode, his release is not entirely monstrous; it’s also heartbreaking.

In the comics, Batman catches Joker and puts him away, like garbage, but in “Joker” it’s the anger, hate and ignorance of humans that made him in the first place.",Jeffrey M. Anderson
8,"Since its debut a few weeks ago at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the top prize, Todd Phillips’s “Joker” has stirred up quite a tempest. Hands have been wrung about the movie’s supposed potential to inspire acts of real-life violence, and criticism of its brutal nihilism has been met with a counter-backlash, including from Phillips himself, who has been sounding off about the “far left” and “woke culture” and other threats to the ability of a murderous clown to make money unmolested. Meanwhile, the usual armies of skeptics and fans have squared off with ready-made accusations of bad faith, hypersensitivity and quasi-fascist groupthink.

We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it’s also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me?
To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. “Joker,” an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity — as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage — the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance.
It barely even works within the confines of its own genre, the comic-book movie. “Joker” is a supervillain origin story, involving a character whose big-screen résumé already includes three Oscar winners (two for other roles, but still). It’s not hard to see the appeal. The Joker, an embodiment of pure anarchy, can be played light or heavy, scary or fun or all at once. He can sneer like Jack Nicholson, snarl like Heath Ledger or … I’m still not sure what Jared Leto was doing, but never mind.
As embodied by Joaquin Phoenix, he laughs a lot — enough to ensure that no one else will. The hallmark of this “Joker” is its solemn witlessness. You might wonder how this could be the work of the same Todd Phillips who directed “The Hangover” and “Road Trip,” which have at least a reputation for being funny. The cleverest bit here is casting Robert De Niro as a late-night, Carsonesque talk-show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.” In that movie, De Niro was the crazy stalker, a talentless wannabe presuming to breathe the same air as his idol and quarry. This time out, he’s in the big chair, feeding the celebrity obsessions of Arthur Fleck.
That’s the Joker’s alter ego: a lonely, damaged man eking out an abject living as a clown-for-hire and living in a drab apartment with his mother (Frances Conroy). Phillips, who wrote the script with Scott Silver, takes us back to the bad old days of Gotham City, when work was scarce, rats were rampant and a garbage strike fouled the streets. Fleck is bullied by thieving poor kids and drunken rich guys, goaded to the point of murder by the meanness of the world. He has a crush on a neighbor (Zazie Beetz) that he thinks might be reciprocated. He keeps a notebook full of stand-up material and works up the nerve to go onstage at a nightclub open-mic night.
There’s nothing wrong with any of these plot points, or with the details that knit “Joker” into the familiar Batman world. Arthur has a connection to the Wayne family — we meet Alfred the butler and young Bruce — and also to Arkham Asylum. The problems arise when the film revs its allegorical engine and Phoenix tries to assemble a character from the tics and tropes he has been given.

Skinny, twitchy and at times startlingly graceful — Phoenix is one of the modern screen’s underrated dancers — Arthur has a physical and psychological resemblance to Freddie Quell, the misfit drifter Phoenix played in “The Master.” But he also carries the burden of being a victimized Everyman in a parable that can’t get its story straight. Arthur’s uncontrollable laughter arises from a medical condition that is possibly the result of childhood abuse. His profound alienation also arises from social inequality, the decline of civility, political corruption, television, government bureaucracy and a slew of other causes. Rich people are awful. Poor people are awful. Joker’s embrace of radical evil becomes a kind of integrity.

Or something. It’s hard to say if the muddle “Joker” makes of itself arises from confusion or cowardice, but the result is less a depiction of nihilism than a story about nothing. The look and the sound — cinematography by Lawrence Sher, cello-heavy score by Hildur Gudnadottir — connote gravity and depth, but the movie is weightless and shallow. It isn’t any fun, and it can’t be taken seriously. Is that the joke?

9,"Edgy and darkly disturbing, Joker takes flight on the wings of a sensational performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It's a complex and complete interpretation of a psychopath whose sense of being invisible is countered by violence. The pitch of the hysteria emanating from the laughter of a man camouflaged by the painted face of a clown is as unsettling as fingernails on a blackboard. Winner of the Golden Lion at the 2019 Venice Film Festival, this is the chilling backstory of Batman's greatest adversary and one of cinema's most memorable villains. While the character may come from the superhero universe, Todd Phillips' film stands alone as a pathos-filled characterization imbuing today's social dilemmas in praise of the vigilante in an anti-establishment culture. Worth seeing for Phoenix's performance alone, this is an electric shock of a movie that is both affecting and thought provoking.

We first meet Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) in his dressing room as he paints a freakish red smile over his clown face. He pulls his lips, distorts his face and the charcoal around his eyes becomes smudged from disturbed tears. He is a man in torment. As the narrative progresses, we edge our way into the cracks of his existence - his relationship with his invalid mother (Frances Conroy), his attractive neighbor (Zazie Beetz), his social worker (Sharon Washington), the man he learns is his father (Brett Cullen) and the TV host who offers him a platform (Robert De Niro). Through each story strand, the cracks and baggage that devour Arthur become more pronounced.

Phillips uses different camera perspectives to unnerve us. The soundscape is effective, too, along with the choice of songs and colour grading. Watch for the scene when Phoenix performs magic tricks to young Bruce Wayne. And the train sequence, when the flickering of the lights as the train veers through a tunnel, provides a perfect eerie backdrop for bloodshed. The violence is in your face and confronting. It is not for the squeamish. Ultimately, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix. He is astonishing.",Louise Keller
3,"Alas, the only remotely entertaining or even mildly interesting aspect of Joker is the notion that it might be so incendiary a depiction of a white man ignored by society who turns to violence that it incites real-life violence by real-life white men who think they are being ignored by society.

In a word: Ha!

To take even this lickspittle snippet of resonance away from the movie, this notion is nought but a metatextual one, not even part of the actual movie. We could say that this is ironically appropriate, if also unintentionally so. Or is it intentional? Did someone set out to make a movie that would (hopefully?) serve as a call to arms for disaffected white men?

Whatever: This pathetically ineffectual movie– as pathetically ineffectual as its protagonist — can only wish to be so dangerous.Joker is faux Scorsese. It is ersatz Christopher Nolan. It is not fit to lick the boots of either Taxi Driver or The Dark Knight, though the height of its ambition would appear to be its desperation to do so. This is a movie so dull, so obvious, that that is the most criminal thing about its portrait of a man “driven” to criminality by “society.” Oh, is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix: Mary Magdalene, Irrational Man) — soon to be the homicidal antagonist to Batman known as the Joker — sad? Is he lonely? Is his life not what he’d hoped it would be? Welcome to humanity, asshole. Deal with it.
Director — and coscreenwriter, with Scott Silver (The Finest Hours, 8 Mile) — Todd Phillips is a filmmaker whose entire “oeuvre” (I use the word loosely) has been about celebrating white-male inadequacy, about white men somehow getting away with skating through life thoroughly unengaged in anything beyond partying (see his Hangover movies), or humiliating white men who try to grow up (see his appalling Due Date). Now, Phillips is attempting to be “serious” by removing all the plausibility-denying fantasy from a comic-book villain by making a movie about him that is “realistic” and “gritty” or whatever-the-hell he thinks gives him cover for indulging male rage as a sorry-not-sorry *wink* response to an unreasonable world.
And yet: It’s still all the same-old justifying nonsense. There is nothing original here… and not because it’s about a comic-book character who has been depicted on screens large and small multiple times. Another white man who has not been handed fame and fortune and respect and sexy willing babes in return for having done absolutely fucking nothing with his life is angry. Cry us a river, pal.

Hello! When you take away the plausibility-denying comic-book fantasy… when you take away the over-the-top absurdity… when you take away the perfectly acceptable nonsensical dispatch of a reason for a clown-faced killer to terrorize a city… now you’re literally vilifying mental illness. (Phillips and Silver give Arthur a condition, in which he laughs uncontrollably in moments that are socially inappropriate, that may be the authentic pseudobulbar affect, or may be something of their own invention. Either way: No.)

Thanks, I hate it. This is not what the world needs right now.

Welcome to a visually washed-out retro Gotham, featuring overtures of late-70s, early 80s New York City — there’s a strike by sanitation workers that is causing black bags of garbage to disgustingly pile up on city streets, which actually happened in the Big Apple in 1977 and 1981. This is where I’m supposed to say that Joaquin Phoenix is “daring” and “radical” or some shit for having lost a lot of weight to play Arthur Fleck, failed stand-up comic, on-call clown for streetside promotions and children’s-ward hospital visits. I’m sure the actor pushed himself physically… but he doesn’t find anything psychologically fresh or intriguing in this character. Arthur is not happy with caring for his not-at-all-well mother (Frances Conroy: Welcome to Happiness, Stone), and he fantasizes a romance with his neighbor (Zazie Beetz [Geostorm]… and fuck this movie for treating her awesome presence even more poorly than Deadpool 2 does). It seems we are meant to automatically, reflexively feel bad for him… as if caring for blood relatives and dreaming of getting it on with people out of our league is not everyday reality for the vast majority of the human race.
Arthur has not been granted the life he wants without having to do the work to earn it… though he fantasizes about that, too, via a late-night TV talk show hosted by *checks notes* Robert De Niro’s Murray Franklin; Arthur likes to dream that Franklin’s show will see Arthur’s alleged comedic genius, invite him on, and, you know, etc. De Niro’s (Joy, The Intern) presence here might be the most inexplicable aspect of this damn movie. I am a huge De Niro fan, but he is bizarrely miscast: he simply does not have the charming, relaxing personality America wants for drifting off to sleep with the TV on in the background. This casting is likely meant to be a nod to De Niro’s King of Comedy turn, but even that suggests a willful misreading of The King of Comedy and of De Niro’s entire cinematic history. Jesus wept, no. Just no.

The real world of 2019 handed Todd Phillips a platter of easy pickin’s: income inequality (billionaire Thomas Wayne [Brett Cullen: The Runaways, Gridiron Gang], ie, Batman’s dad, is the ostensible villain here); the collapse of social services (the safety net that helps Arthur deal with his mental illness is cut); even the not-so-quiet rage of pathetically ineffectual men threatening to boil over into civil unrest. And Joker does not one thing interesting or engaging with it. It pushes no envelopes. It is not edgy in any respect. It is just… here. And it assumes that its mere existence is reason to applaud. It most definitely is not.

10,"Arthur Flick wants to be a standup comedian. Unfortunately he’s not funny and also has a condition that he laughs at inappropriate points. He’s got a lot of problems, especially when they cut funding for his therapist and he’s taken off all his medication all at once. This is not the Joker as he rises to power, instead this is the Joker as he slowly becomes himself in this very intense character piece into a mentally deranged individual.

This movie is about power. The power to move people or the power to control people. In Gotham City, the rich have all the power. They have the ability to suddenly cut the funding of the poor people looking for therapy. They have the power to hide in their gated mansions or turn people away simply because they’re poor. It shows how one man, with absolutely nothing, learns to take his own power back. Of course, being this isn’t a movie about a hero, or even an anti-hero, but this is the first supervillain movie I think I’ve seen. Venom, doesn’t count, he’s an anti-hero in that film. I might count Barry Lyndon though…

This is a movie that took me completely by surprise. It’s not an action movie, like pretty much every other superhero movie, and goes straight in between drama and psychological thriller. It’s poignant, another thing that seems to be missing from most other movies with supervillains in them. It’s not like any movie I’ve seen, actually, whether having heroes or not. It’s an important film, that’s also something I would never have expected from a film based on the most off-the-wall-bonkers insane super-criminal that Batman has to face off with. This film has meaning. It’s important. And everyone old enough to see an R-rated movie should probably give it a watch. This isn’t just another film, but a story of how far a man is willing to go when he sees the injustice all around him.

Still, I wouldn’t say Joker should be anyone’s hero (again this is a supervillain movie, we aren’t meant to idolize the main character). Especially not the people living in Gotham City. But, at the same time, I know why people follow him. He’s pure chaos incarnate, he’ll kill you just for a laugh, and some people “just want to watch the world burn,” as Alfred put it in the Dark Knight. And the Joker is the only person who can show you the world burning at almost every given time. Of course, most of those murders only ever make sense to him, except in this movie it all makes sense. The director and Joaquin Phoenix makes it make sense because that’s how far into the Joker’s psyche that we delve through the course of the film.

Also, I want to talk about the Killing Joke for just a bit. This is the ultimate Joker comic and shows one version of his origin story, but as you read and reread it you might start to notice a few things, such as the same characters appear to show up again and again, but in different roles, or how one panel might directly contradict the next, or a panel pages later. You start to notice that there’s cracks in the story itself, and it becomes more and more clear that Joker is really just making it all up (or he’s just crazy, definitely one of those…). This is because the Joker doesn’t have a true origin story. It’s why the story keeps changing in the Dark Knight whenever that particular Joker said “you know how I got these scars…” There’s similar things here, though the film does tell you that one specific storyline was completely made up, after they did that I started wondering just how much of the rest of this story is really happening. Did Joker kill those three guys on the train or did he just watch it on the news and then make believe he did? It’s questions like that which plague me as I watch through this film but ultimately, just like with the Killing Joke, it doesn’t actually matter what the Joker’s origins are. He’s more like an elemental, pure chaos incarnate, and this shows us one way he may have become the way he is, but it’s not the only way. Joker prefers the multiple choice origin story.",Nathaniel R. Mitchell
9,"Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a man on the edge.  He works as a clown, takes care of his mother (Frances Conroy), and is trying to be a stand-up comedian while dealing with multiple mental illnesses.  Cut off from his funded healthcare and medication, Arthur suddenly finds himself unemployed and questioning everything he thought he knew was true about his life when tragedy strikes…and it could be the best thing that ever happened to Arthur.
Directed by Todd Phillips (who also helped write the film with Scott Silver), Joker is a comic book drama.  The film is based on the Batman villain and received criticism upon its release due to the film’s violent tone and idolization of the character.  The film was released at the Venice Film Festival where it won the Golden Lion.  The film was released to largely critical praise and a massive box-office release.  The film led the Academy Award nominations winning for Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score with nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.  The film also received a Razzie nomination for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property.

I am a comic book fan, and Joker upset non-comic book fans and comic book fans alike due to the conversations that swirled around it.  It is in those conversations and the tone of the movie which helps elevate Joker above a lot of its contemporaries…but it also can kind of blur the film’s message.
The movie is basically a comic book movie at heart…it has a comic book “villain” and involvement of Bruce Wayne, his father, his mother, and even Alfred Pennyworth.  This is where the comic book ties almost end.  You have a movie that is primarily a drama about mental illness and the failings of the system linked arm and arm with this comic book set-up.  For people who believe that comic book movies are popcorn and fun, this diminishes some of the message because they might not see it.  For those who want a comic book movie, an art house presentation of a classic villain without the flash and visuals of something like Avengers or even The Dark Knight.

The movie is really a condemnation about the treatment of mental illness, and the even more current trend of elevating people into heroes without considering the consequences or if they can handle it.  Arthur knows he’s sick, people recognize he’s sick, his meds aren’t working anymore, he’s been cut off from counseling, and he has easy access to a weapon…it is a bad combination.  The people turn the subway killer into a hero and this further inflates Arthur’s delusions that it is a sign of acceptance.  It’s a vicious circle that feels appropriate in this day and age where YouTube stars shoot to fame (and a number have been taken down by past digressions).
The film works because of Joaquin Phoenix.  The character and script borrowed heavily from Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver but it is almost what happens to Bickle after the end of the film.  While Bickle wasn’t getting mental help and did what he did as a result, Joker was getting help and the failure of that help contributed to the bad results.

Phoenix has great back-up in Robert DeNiro as the Johnny Carson-esque talk show host and Frances Conroy as Fleck’s equally disturbed mother.  Zazie Beetz has a small but important role to demonstrate the depths of Fleck’s condition and the movie also features new performers portraying classic comic book characters Brett Cullen (Thomas Wayne), Carrie Louise Putrello (Martha Wayne), Douglas Hodge (Alfred Pennyworth), and Dante Pereira-Olson (Bruce Wayne).
The movie has a great throwback look that also mimics Taxi Driver and Scorsese’s early films.  It gets the grimy horror and dirty look that made those movies successful.  This combines with a soundtrack emphasizing the character’s obsessions and sicknesses.  A big criticism was drawn by the use of convicted pedophile Gary Glitter’s “Rock ‘n’ Roll (Part 2)”, but I would feel more critical of this if I didn’t hear high school and college bands play it all the time without more judgment.

Joker will not be for everyone (and it definitely is not for kids or younger viewers).  The whole film is presented as a possible mind-game if you look at in some ways (especially considering the last scene in a very American Psycho-esque moment).  It is the type of movie that challenges you while watching it because you have to keep recognizing that you are watching a film about a mentally ill character.  Joaquin Phoenix is hypnotic in the film and gives one of his best performances which both enhances the story and builds more criticism for the idolization of killers without looking at the faults and potential solutions to prevent tragedies from happening.  What do you do when the pills don’t work or stop working, what do you do with a person who could potentially commit a crime but is on the street because he or she hasn’t?  Those are questions posed by Joker that society needs to answer…and at least Joker is spawning more conversation about it.",JP Roscoe
8,"Arthur Fleck laughs, sometimes inappropriately, so that he may not cry.   Or kill.   Even if Joker were not an origins story about Batman's greatest nemesis, Joker would still be a gritty and riveting tale of an ordinary man teetering on the edge of sanity.    Borrowing in spirit from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker's Arthur Fleck is a professional clown engaged in daily conflict with his demons.    He was once institutionalized, he regularly visits an overworked social worker in a messy office, and takes seven different medications to battle his various psychological ailments.    As Joker opens, he is mugged while performing a sidewalk gig holding up a ""going out of business"" sign.    Things don't get any better for him.

Arthur takes care of his ailing mother, who once worked for Thomas Wayne (Cullen), the billionaire industrialist and father of Bruce who is running for mayor of early 1980's Gotham, which is in the midst of a sanitation workers' strike and is overflowing with bags of garbage left untouched on city streets.    Tensions in Gotham are escalating to nightmarish proportions, and this mirrors the tensions within Arthur himself.    A co-worker sells Arthur a gun so he can protect himself at his gigs, which is akin to giving an arsonist gasoline and a match.

Arthur's hellish life drifts into focus.   He finds a measure of relief in a budding romance with his neighbor Sophie (Beetz), who smiles at him in the elevator and doesn't appear to be turned off by his generally creepy demeanor.    When faced with a scary situation or potential conflict, Arthur laughs maniacally and uncontrollably.    He attributes it to his past physical and psychological trauma, and he isn't wrong.

How Arthur ties into, or doesn't tie into the Wayne family is soon explained.    We see how, in Arthur's world, not everything is what it seems.    His fragile state of mind leaves open the question as to what is real and what isn't.    One night on the subway, Arthur kills three yuppie creeps and finds elation in the act.   It is the release he has sought, and soon finds violence is his nature.    Through all this, we still sympathize with him, because while he clearly grows into a psychopath, we have to suspect it is due at least in part to past abuse and an altogether sad existence.  

Nothing Joaquin Phoenix has done before prepared me for his excellent work here.    I've enjoyed and appreciated him in Gladiator, Walk the Line, The Sisters Brothers, We Own the Night, and a few other films throughout his long career.    Other times, I wasn't much moved by him because I couldn't get a sense of who was inside.    He knew the words, but not the music.   His Arthur Fleck is sad, monosyllabic, inarticulate, and full of seething rage.    He cannot verbalize fully how trapped he feels, how his afflictions have hindered him, and how cannot break free without resorting to relenting to his crueler, violent nature.  

The Gotham of Todd Phillips' film is filthy, ugly, and unsightly.   The skies are gray.   Even the interiors are gray and dirty.   There isn't much sunshine, and what little exists is seen through windows from the inside.    There is much happiness to be found here, but the effect isn't depressing, but instead adds atmosphere.    Arthur's dreams of stand-up comedy fame intersect with TV talk show host Murray Franklin (DeNiro), whom Arthur idolizes.   Murray's show, which resembles Johnny Carson's Tonight Show right down to the multi-colored curtain from which Murray and his guests emerge, attempts to bring at least some semblance of joy to the increasingly turbulent Gotham.   It also attracts people like Arthur to hang around its periphery yearning to belong.

There are an abundance of reports and columns concerning the violence in Joker and how it stigmatizes the mentally ill as repugnant and violent.    I don't agree that Joker is any more violent than other films.   (Apparently no such uproar was made about Rambo: Last Blood, which was almost violence porn).    Joker has its share of blood and violence, but the violent scenes are isolated and contain their own individual reasons for their existence, most as a tragic form of release for Arthur.
Joker is Arthur's individual story, and doesn't purport to be an allegory about society's treatment of the mentally ill or how the mentally ill are more prone to violent acts.    Joker is instead a story told with superb craftmanship and anchored by a Phoenix performance which hits all the right notes about an odd, tormented, yet still sympathetic character.    The story of The Joker is so fully and expertly realized that I hope it isn't watered down with an unnecessary sequel.",Doug Fisher
5,"As a villain in Batman’s rogues’ gallery, Joker has been returned to repeatedly. He’s the classic archenemy, with a nuclear psychological profile that makes him a viable threat and a thematic counterpoint to the Caped Crusader’s own dalliance with insanity. In film and television, Joker has been portrayed by a number of talented actors, each giving the part a unique spin while still tending to the traditional madness of the character as it exists in the Batman universe. Co-writer/director Todd Phillips seems to be tired of the superhero norm, delivering “Joker,” an origin story for the Clown Prince of Crime that slowly makes its way into an abyss of mental illness, refusing the lure of Batman to remain with the villain as he samples the cruelties of the world, helping him to become the sadistic madman known to all. Phillips has a big idea for “Joker,” but he doesn’t make much of a movie with it, with the possibilities of the feature more enticing than the realities of it.
In the early 1980s, Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) is trying to keep on grip on things while struggling with mental health issues, including uncontrollable laughter when his anxiety rises. He’s a clown by trade, but life in Gotham City is no laughing matter, with Arthur assaulted on the job, only to return home to care for his sickly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Arthur is heavily medicated and holds on to a dream of stand-up comedy, hoping to appear on “The Murray Franklin Show,” finally offered a chance to meet the late-night talk show host (Robert De Niro), wowing him with his performance skills. But the days only grow darker for Arthur, who deals poorly with the loss of his job, while a moment of subway harassment leads to a triple murder, which turns the clown-painted aggressor into a symbol for the city’s poor and forgotten, finally giving Arthur the bloodthirsty audience he’s been craving all along.

Gotham City is in trouble. There’s a garbage strike, permitting rats to rule the streets, and crime is common, creating a battleground for a guy like Arthur. He lives with his mother, trying to be a dutiful son, earning a living and listening to Penny’s pleas to get into contact with her former employer, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), the egocentric billionaire who’s running for public office. Arthur’s life is his apartment, taking time out from stewing in his own filth to surf on his imagination, conjuring visions of appearing with Murray Franklin, charming his audience. Arthur even has an empowerment dance, enjoying a private sway now and then, enjoying the freedom of his dreams, which offer a stark contrast to the reality of his life. Joker isn’t formed at the beginning of the picture, as Phillips (with co-writer Scott Silver) endeavors to draw out the process for as long as possible, more fascinated with Arthur’s brewing violence than the iconic end result of weaponized insanity.
There could be a lot more to “Joker,” which mostly remains a character study, staying up close with Arthur has he experiences the world’s heartlessness. The system has lost its funding, severing Arthur from his dispassionate therapist and his medicine. He’s unable to stay employed, losing his job as a clown for hire due to a poor decision to bring a gun into a children’s hospital. And he’s curious about Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a single mother who lives nearby and shows interest in Arthur’s special sense of humor. Phillips lingers on Arthur’s pain for extended periods of screentime, particularly in love with the laugh, which isn’t a gleeful release of craziness, but a sickly, throat-tearing squeal that acts up when the battered man loses control. The goal of “Joker” is to make the audience as uncomfortable as possible, and the laugh, the sheer excess of it, is an effective tool for the filmmaker. But after that, Phillips doesn’t have much, finding the screenplay one-note after introductions are made, while the feature’s lone mystery (involving the identity of Arthur’s father) isn’t captivating, offered only as perfunctory plot in a picture that’s purely about corrosive ambiance (though gorgeously photographed by Lawrence Sher).
“Joker” moves aimlessly from scene to scene, weaving in and out of reality to a point where nothing on screen can be trusted, though a true dreamlike odyssey is avoided. There’s graphic violence, with Phillips recreating the Bernard Goetz subway vigilante experience to bring Joker into the light, inspiring Gotham City to rise up with fists and clown masks to take down the 1%, though the bigness of the cause is never fully realized. And while Phoenix commits to the part, he’s recycling previous performances, once again doing unhinged with head-quaking fury. As for Batman, there’s some connective tissue to future superhero war, but Phillips isn’t here to play up Joker’s role in the D.C. Universe, he wants to watch it burn for two hours, putting his own stamp of nihilism and gut-rot on the flamboyant character. It’s a valiant effort, especially in brighter comic book entertainment times, but “Joker” does one thing and nothing more, delivering more drag than excitement.",Brian Orndorf
8,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is memorable, and this villain origin story is written nicely...

Among the many villains Batman has faced, one easily stands out: the wicked clown-faced criminal known as the Joker. This is a character we have seen plenty of times over the years, portrayed in different styles by multiple actors. There's the comical presentation of Joker by Cesar Romero in the 1960s Batman television series, and even, for that matter, the silly Joker in The Lego Batman Movie recently. For something mildly dark, there's Jack Nicholson's Joker in the 1989 Batman movie and Mark Hamill voicing the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series in TV in the 1990s. Then, if you really want an ultra dark Joker, look no further than Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance in The Dark Knight in 2008. With such a high bar set, it would be a challenge to reach the same level of excellence that Ledger achieved.

Now we have Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, who also fits in the same category of ultra dark. Obviously, the first question is whether Phoenix or Ledger is better as the Joker. Honestly, I find it hard to decide. It's not just because they're both great in their own way. It's also because these actors portray different stages of the Joker's descent to evil. Whereas Ledger's Joker is in the deepest part of the abyss, Phoenix's Joker is at the edge of it and already sliding down slowly towards its center. It's almost like comparing apples and oranges, so I say we just proceed to look at Phoenix's Joker closely without further comparisons.

Phoenix plays a man in Gotham City named Arthur Fleck. He appears at first to be like any ordinary person, with a job (as a party clown), a place to live (a rundown apartment), and a living family member (his mother Penny, played by Frances Conroy). But look closely and you'll see someone who is disturbed. A mental health specialist may note Arthur's limited emotional expression, wide-eyed stare, sharing of negative thoughts, and involuntary laughter not matching the context of the situation. So yeah, he's pretty damaged from the moment we first see him. But you know what else is messed up? His circumstances. Just when you think he may be able to barely hold it together while going through life, bad luck strikes multiple times.

Basically, a series of unfortunate events pushes this already fragile man to the brink. The descent suddenly quickens after Arthur commits murder, which may not have been a planned first-degree incident, but it still sets two things into motion: a police investigation that soon heads his way, and a citywide revolution by the masses against the wealthy class. By this time, we may feel a bit of sorrow and sympathy for Arthur, because it's clear that society has treated him unfairly. The same could apply to many other residents of Gotham City struggling to make ends meet.

As the story proceeds, Arthur continues to be pushed around. More things happen that trigger anger towards those around him, further feeding the notion that society is cruel and working against him, never for him. This leads to further moral decline. There are also a few more killings, which are shocking not just because of the amount of on-screen blood shown but also because of how unexpected they are. And at just the right moment, he puts on a frightening clown persona and fully transforms into the Joker.

Although there is a plot in this film, it's not the primary focus. The story can be described simply as a series of events that influence the main character and lead him down the path of evil transformation. It's not one of those movies that has plot twists and an epic climax. In fact, the climax in this movie is one that you'll likely not notice to be a climax until after it's over. So Joker is not a plot-based movie. Rather, it's primarily a fascinating character study that dives deeper into a familiar fictional character.

There's another secondary element worth mentioning: social commentary. Beyond the world of Gotham City, this film presents a microcosm of the society we live in. Like the real world, Gotham City has a large wealth gap between the haves and have-nots, plus associated poverty, unemployment, and crime. The film also reminds us how selfish we can be sometimes, and that has unfair consequences for certain other individuals. That in turn reminds us that the concept of the villain is relative. Traditionally, Batman is on the side of good and the Joker is on the side of evil. But in this film, it seems Gotham City is the villain and the Joker is the one trying to make things right in whatever circumstances. This is another reason I appreciate seeing things from the Joker's perspective.

Obviously, this is not a superhero movie, which is something you see a lot these days. Rather, it's a supervillain movie, providing a new take on an established genre. I definitely appreciated this movie for doing something dramatically different and doing it well. It was fun seeing the Joker's life before Batman came along. That's not to say there's no indirect reference to Batman, because the young Bruce Wayne, who will eventually become Batman, appears briefly in this film, as a way to connect the Joker back to Batman and to better see how one influenced the other. Again, another neat take on a familiar story.

Now, will we see more origin films centering on superhero villains? I say maybe. If this film is any indication of what's possible, I expect more will be coming along, and they will really expand the already huge genre of superhero movies.",Anthony
6,"The beauty of films about superheroes and cultural icons, and/or adapted from popular works, is that you’ve got a ready-made audience, but more importantly, potential viewers know what game they’re stepping into. Joker, for good or ill, certainly wants the former, but is playing rather fast and loose with the latter.

Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled guy, and while he has an unequal share of everyman problems, he also has a lot of prescriptions for his psychological issues. He also exists in a Gotham City that is seemingly falling apart. A garbage worker strike is causing problems you can easily imagine, and a budget crisis sees the city cutting services left and right.
Part of the overall “construction” of Joker stems from Arthur’s work as a clown, and his dream of being a stand-up comic, but it mostly comes down to the system endlessly flailing at a guy after taking away his meds. None of this is helped by inserting Arthur into a foreboding urban backdrop that has the fight between the haves and the have nots leaving the city crumbling under its own weight.

The film paints a vivid, and even a beautifully dark portrait, and at times Phoenix is a wonder to watch, but in any sense in which films are to be judged above and beyond a series of pictures Joker leaves a lot to be desired. It isn’t, except in the utterly boring sense that it technically is, about Joker at all, and writer/director Todd Phillips belabors every aspect of his narrative as though he is imparting some glorious and esoteric truth upon the masses he doesn’t think much of.
Arthur isn’t simply beaten down by the system, living a depressing life in virtual squalor, he is literally beaten down, harassed nonsensically by his boss, and given a social worker who doesn’t listen to him and shrugs off the insane ramblings in his journal. He isn’t vaguely “crazed” or have psychopathic tendencies, he has a dozen drugs trying to keep his varied (and unnamed) psychological conditions in check, hallucinates, and has pseudobulbar affect so we can get his laughing on board. He isn’t simply a victim, he’s a victim a hundred times over, and ultimately becomes the victim of everyone, and from angles even he couldn’t see coming.
While this alternate Joker origin, the one in which he isn’t a “villain” already and has no ability to be any kind of mastermind, criminal or otherwise, is one that dangles a lot of potential, our story here negates everything the Joker has always been, and even its own effort by the time it’s done. Where Joker has long managed to force audiences to question, or at least discuss, the madness inherent in ethics and morality while putting a spectacularly creepy face on dastardly machinations, this Joker transcends evil and even villainy altogether.
In much the way Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises loses itself under the weight of its societal klaxon, becoming only accidentally a Batman film, Joker is more concerned with delivering its punchline (in an all-time great among stagy, ineffective scenes) than a character that makes sense or a road that ultimately leads anywhere. The scenery is lovely and if Phoenix is, in fact, portraying precisely what Phillips wanted then he’s a genius, but pure crazy is boring and funneling it through a kind of hyperbolic ethos so you can make a political statement as daring as “leaving mental patients to their own devices is bad” doesn’t change that.",Marc Eastman
8,"Possibly the most hyped-up release in recent memory (aside from Endgame, ‘cause, c’mon, nothing’s gonna top a tentpole Disney release, amiright?), Joker was said to provide an already storied character with the appropriately-vaunted cinematic origin story he has so deserved all these years. And we certainly get something along those lines, as we watch young (I guess…more on that in a bit) Arthur as he suffers from an uncomfortable laughing condition and attempts to make it big as a stand-up comedian. He runs up against the wall of late-silver/early-bronze age Gotham City, replete with crime, corruption, and bad times for well-meaning folks like Arthur. As he’s pushed further and further by the darkness around him, he begins to increasingly resemble the Crown Prince of Crime that we all know and love today.

While not a complete mess by any stretch, I can’t say that I enjoyed Joker all that much. Joaquin Phoenix is a damned beast, and his lead performance helped keep me going during periods of doubt and boredom. Beyond him, though, there was little to outwardly like. I dug the fact that the world held a dingy, oppressive atmosphere, not unlike the New York that kept 42nd Street alive and kicking in its filthy prime, but it became a bit much, especially when it led to the sacrifice of rich or varied colors. (It ain’t Snyder’s Gotham, but it’s also far from Jenkins’ Themyscira.) The script, while not being nearly as bad as previous DC offerings, is still trite and copies handily from other films, like The King of Comedy. Everything is very on-the-nose, and motivations spring up suddenly, always with a just-so attitude.

What really hampers things, though, is the idea that the film was even necessary to begin with. I have no problem with providing Phoenix some prime steak ‘pon which to cut his teeth and ply his trade (people ply their trades on steaks, right?), but here it’s in the service of needlessly telling the story of how a villain came to be. In every prior incarnation of the character I’ve seen, the Joker’s either just shown up as-is, preformed somewhere in the primordial past, or he’s given a modicum of a backstory, usually involving him being a particularly loony gangster or criminal who rose through the ranks by dint of his madness, verve, and brutality. This lack of a wholly humanizing angle has helped keep the character mysterious, frightening, everything a top-class villain should be. Here, we see a guy who quite literally wanted to be a clown, only to have the world spit in his face, to which he responded by turning into a vicious, seemingly nihilistic madman. Sure. Can you see how this might water down his legend, even just a little bit?

Worse, I didn’t feel the film was all that convincing or compelling. Sure, Arthur was repeatedly dealt a rough hand, but his antagonists are all cardboard and hyperbolic, never feeling genuine, and his reaction, frankly, rings rather more short-sighted and immediate than fully understandable. I couldn’t find myself empathizing with Arthur for very long, ‘cause he’d just go and do something weird or violent and then go along his merry way. It’s not a constant deluge of darkness that turns him, but a punctuated series of itemized, well-spaced, regularly-paced steps. Shit, I’d rather remember him just wanting to be a criminal and letting his innate malevolence lead the way, even though that version of his origin is admittedly potentially less interesting and/or satisfying. Plus, there’s the whole question of just how old Arthur is supposed to be, given the time period and how we know things shake out in the DC Universe (I mean, were one to gauge it by Phoenix’s appearance, the Joker would be nearing retirement age when he takes on Batman in the coming decades), which took me out of things just that tiny bit more.

Credit where it’s due to writer/producer/director Todd Phillips, he did a decent-enough job in forging an atmospheric and heavy film, but it just plain didn’t work for me, especially when he gets on his “we live in a society”-style bullshit as he goes on. It’s an impressive move for the guy who showed us just how easy it was to drive an alright comedic idea into the ground with only three movies, but I can’t call it a complete success.
Cuck, on the other hand, kinda surprised me with how well it turned out and portrayed a similar story. Here, young Ronald (everybody calls him Ronnie, but I’m just gonna go ahead and call him Ronald, ‘cause I’m an asshole like that) finds himself in quite the bad emotional spot: The son of a late soldier, he can’t enlist in the army due to psychological issues; he lives under the thumb of his manipulative mother (trust me, the years we didn’t see are likely a much darker supervillain origin story than Joker could ever hope to be); he’s got a hard time finding and/or holding a job, what him thinking he’s above certain work and his inability to fully get along with certain others; he’s bad with women, thanks to both the heavy hand of his mother during his upbringing and a (likely consequently) negative view toward women; and he can’t help but notice just how well certain other people are doing, namely those of other races. Like many of his situation, he’s increasingly turning to the internet for bolstering, be it from right-wing nutjobs on YouTube (or, at least, the equivalent platform invented for the film) or from the ladies of good ol’ pornography. As he digs deeper into the rabbit hole, even starting up his own ranty channel extolling the virtues of the American Dream and condemning all those liberal “cucks” who’re ruining things for patriots like him, he gets involved with the online sex show produced by his comely neighbor. Little does he realize just how precarious his mental state truly is, and how far off the deep end he can go.

Immediately, I was struck by the humanity exhibited in Zachary Ray Sherman’s Ronald: As an avowed left-wing ninny myself (I think I’ve made many of my views clear in previous posts, so no gasps, kids), I expected to just look down my nose at the little bastard, but I often found myself actually feeling for the kid. We see that he is willing to try at life, even if he almost always turns his back in the end, and some of his breaks do indeed seem pretty rough. Although he’s clearly got something of a daddy complex and some mildly arrested development, the film shows that he is still the product of his own decisions, that his hole is deepened more by his reactive choices to his circumstances than the circumstances themselves. Sherman plays the part just as punchably as the character deserves, but he leaves enough naivete and pain in there to ensure that we never fully scoff him away. I assumed the right-wing loonery we’d see would be at least slightly on-the-nose and obvious, and it definitely is, but it’s given the context that allows it to feel natural, the result of Ronald’s conscious and unconscious choices, and his delivery of the classic talking points – we’re talking your antisemitism, your xenophobia, your homo- and transphobia, your uber-militaristic nationalism, those sorts of things – is natural enough to not come across like a polished talking head, but rather like a downtrodden loser who’s regurgitating them while clinging to their underlying philosophies in the hopes of staving off utter desolation. Even better, it’s clear the film thinks rather lowly of these ideas, unlike the relative ambivalence exhibited by Joker.

What really sold me on the narrative, though, is the way Ronald finally discovers just how low he can sink. He becomes infatuated with his neighbor, played by the always-engaging and -lovely Monique Parent, and sets out to woo her in his own bedraggled way. This leads to him joining in on her internet-based sexcapades, always as the put-upon guy who’s shown up by another, all while he’s tasked with masturbating to the scene before him. If you haven’t caught the hint yet, he’s playing the part of the cuckold. The cuck. Worse, he doesn’t even realize it, what with his delusions and the fact that he really only understands the term as a blanket insult, the way “idiot” and “dick” have lost their original meanings over the past decades’ use (I admit to dropping some hard Fs and Rs in my day in similar fashions, never intending to invoke the proper definitional implications of the words). When he finds out what it really means, and that he has been coerced into being one, you can see the twigs snap behind his eyes. It’s quite a shift, and credit goes to the filmmakers for employing this revelatory methodology, as it’s pretty effective.

So while Arthur’s descent isn’t quite as genuine-feeling as it could have been, Ronald’s reeks of real-world angst and sadness. You can tell he’s clutching to the only things that have made sense in his life, accentuating the vehement reactions against the seemingly opposing forces in the vain hope of maintaining his heroes’ status quo – and his own by association. At the end, you feel the mixed feelings you should: You shake your head not just because some asshat did some dastardly shit, but also because of the potential that was needlessly wasted. I never got that feeling whilst watching the Joker take his bows and dance about, but Ronnie brought out just the right amount of sympathy without forcing me to abandon my own beliefs.

While there are some issues with Cuck, like some overactive editing and a fairly dime-sized narrative turning point, I can’t help but warm to it. If you really wanna see a mind descend into the depths and take on its perceived transgressors with hatred and violence, do yourself a favor and opt for Cuck, it’s got a better heart and a stronger head on its shoulders. If you need to budget and the polish, Joker isn’t truly bad, so you aren’t likely to make too big a mistake here.
